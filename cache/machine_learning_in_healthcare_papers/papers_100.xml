    <title>Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  As a subfield of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) aims at
empowering one's capabilities in behavioural decision making by using
interaction experience with the world and an evaluative feedback. Unlike
traditional supervised learning methods that usually rely on one-shot,
exhaustive and supervised reward signals, RL tackles with sequential decision
making problems with sampled, evaluative and delayed feedback simultaneously.
Such distinctive features make RL technique a suitable candidate for developing
powerful solutions in a variety of healthcare domains, where diagnosing
decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged and
sequential procedure. This survey discusses the broad applications of RL
techniques in healthcare domains, in order to provide the research community
with systematic understanding of theoretical foundations, enabling methods and
techniques, existing challenges, and new insights of this emerging paradigm. By
first briefly examining theoretical foundations and key techniques in RL
research from efficient and representational directions, we then provide an
overview of RL applications in healthcare domains ranging from dynamic
treatment regimes in chronic diseases and critical care, automated medical
diagnosis from both unstructured and structured clinical data, as well as many
other control or scheduling domains that have infiltrated many aspects of a
healthcare system. Finally, we summarize the challenges and open issues in
current research, and point out some potential solutions and directions for
future research.

    <title>A Survey on Federated Learning for the Healthcare Metaverse: Concepts,
  Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
    <summary>  Recent technological advancements have considerately improved healthcare
systems to provide various intelligent healthcare services and improve the
quality of life. Federated learning (FL), a new branch of artificial
intelligence (AI), opens opportunities to deal with privacy issues in
healthcare systems and exploit data and computing resources available at
distributed devices. Additionally, the Metaverse, through integrating emerging
technologies, such as AI, cloud edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
blockchain, and semantic communications, has transformed many vertical domains
in general and the healthcare sector in particular. Obviously, FL shows many
benefits and provides new opportunities for conventional and Metaverse
healthcare, motivating us to provide a survey on the usage of FL for Metaverse
healthcare systems. First, we present preliminaries to IoT-based healthcare
systems, FL in conventional healthcare, and Metaverse healthcare. The benefits
of FL in Metaverse healthcare are then discussed, from improved privacy and
scalability, better interoperability, better data management, and extra
security to automation and low-latency healthcare services. Subsequently, we
discuss several applications pertaining to FL-enabled Metaverse healthcare,
including medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, medical education, infectious
disease, and drug discovery. Finally, we highlight significant challenges and
potential solutions toward the realization of FL in Metaverse healthcare.

    <title>Selecting Interpretability Techniques for Healthcare Machine Learning
  models</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare there is a pursuit for employing interpretable algorithms to
assist healthcare professionals in several decision scenarios. Following the
Predictive, Descriptive and Relevant (PDR) framework, the definition of
interpretable machine learning as a machine-learning model that explicitly and
in a simple frame determines relationships either contained in data or learned
by the model that are relevant for its functioning and the categorization of
models by post-hoc, acquiring interpretability after training, or model-based,
being intrinsically embedded in the algorithm design. We overview a selection
of eight algorithms, both post-hoc and model-based, that can be used for such
purposes.

    <title>Machine Learning for Healthcare-IoT Security: A Review and Risk
  Mitigation</title>
    <summary>  The Healthcare Internet-of-Things (H-IoT), commonly known as Digital
Healthcare, is a data-driven infrastructure that highly relies on smart sensing
devices (i.e., blood pressure monitors, temperature sensors, etc.) for faster
response time, treatments, and diagnosis. However, with the evolving cyber
threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk
surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if
exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command
and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of
healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with
machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance
of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and
application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various
cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things
(NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust
authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques
is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity
vulnerabilities. Hence, in this review paper, security and privacy challenges
and risk mitigation strategies for building resilience in H-IoT are explored
and reported.

    <title>Introduction to Machine Learning for Physicians: A Survival Guide for
  Data Deluge</title>
    <summary>  Many modern research fields increasingly rely on collecting and analysing
massive, often unstructured, and unwieldy datasets. Consequently, there is
growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications
that can harness this `data deluge'. This broad nontechnical overview provides
a gentle introduction to machine learning with a specific focus on medical and
biological applications. We explain the common types of machine learning
algorithms and typical tasks that can be solved, illustrating the basics with
concrete examples from healthcare. Lastly, we provide an outlook on open
challenges, limitations, and potential impacts of machine-learning-powered
medicine.

    <title>MD-Manifold: A Medical-Distance-Based Representation Learning Approach
  for Medical Concept and Patient Representation</title>
    <summary>  Effectively representing medical concepts and patients is important for
healthcare analytical applications. Representing medical concepts for
healthcare analytical tasks requires incorporating medical domain knowledge and
prior information from patient description data. Current methods, such as
feature engineering and mapping medical concepts to standardized terminologies,
have limitations in capturing the dynamic patterns from patient description
data. Other embedding-based methods have difficulties in incorporating
important medical domain knowledge and often require a large amount of training
data, which may not be feasible for most healthcare systems. Our proposed
framework, MD-Manifold, introduces a novel approach to medical concept and
patient representation. It includes a new data augmentation approach, concept
distance metric, and patient-patient network to incorporate crucial medical
domain knowledge and prior data information. It then adapts manifold learning
methods to generate medical concept-level representations that accurately
reflect medical knowledge and patient-level representations that clearly
identify heterogeneous patient cohorts. MD-Manifold also outperforms other
state-of-the-art techniques in various downstream healthcare analytical tasks.
Our work has significant implications in information systems research in
representation learning, knowledge-driven machine learning, and using design
science as middle-ground frameworks for downstream explorative and predictive
analyses. Practically, MD-Manifold has the potential to create effective and
generalizable representations of medical concepts and patients by incorporating
medical domain knowledge and prior data information. It enables deeper insights
into medical data and facilitates the development of new analytical
applications for better healthcare outcomes.

    <title>An Empirical Study of Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning
  in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been applied to sequential
estimation and prediction problems identifying and developing hypothetical
treatment strategies for septic patients, with a particular focus on offline
learning with observational data. In practice, successful RL relies on
informative latent states derived from sequential observations to develop
optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best to construct such states in a
healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical
study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic
patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state.
We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with
established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We
find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy
learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to
representation learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial
nature of healthcare data.

    <title>Unsupervised anomaly detection for discrete sequence healthcare data</title>
    <summary>  Fraud in healthcare is widespread, as doctors could prescribe unnecessary
treatments to increase bills. Insurance companies want to detect these
anomalous fraudulent bills and reduce their losses. Traditional fraud detection
methods use expert rules and manual data processing.
  Recently, machine learning techniques automate this process, but hand-labeled
data is extremely costly and usually out of date. We propose a machine learning
model that automates fraud detection in an unsupervised way. Two deep learning
approaches include LSTM neural network for prediction next patient visit and a
seq2seq model. For normalization of produced anomaly scores, we propose
Empirical Distribution Function (EDF) approach. So, the algorithm works with
high class imbalance problems.
  We use real data on sequences of patients' visits data from Allianz company
for the validation. The models provide state-of-the-art results for
unsupervised anomaly detection for fraud detection in healthcare. Our EDF
approach further improves the quality of LSTM model.

    <title>Deep Cox Mixtures for Survival Regression</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis is a challenging variation of regression modeling because
of the presence of censoring, where the outcome measurement is only partially
known, due to, for example, loss to follow up. Such problems come up frequently
in medical applications, making survival analysis a key endeavor in
biostatistics and machine learning for healthcare, with Cox regression models
being amongst the most commonly employed models. We describe a new approach for
survival analysis regression models, based on learning mixtures of Cox
regressions to model individual survival distributions. We propose an
approximation to the Expectation Maximization algorithm for this model that
does hard assignments to mixture groups to make optimization efficient. In each
group assignment, we fit the hazard ratios within each group using deep neural
networks, and the baseline hazard for each mixture component
non-parametrically.
  We perform experiments on multiple real world datasets, and look at the
mortality rates of patients across ethnicity and gender. We emphasize the
importance of calibration in healthcare settings and demonstrate that our
approach outperforms classical and modern survival analysis baselines, both in
terms of discriminative performance and calibration, with large gains in
performance on the minority demographics.

    <title>Automatically Explaining Machine Learning Prediction Results: A
  Demonstration on Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Background: Predictive modeling is a key component of solutions to many
healthcare problems. Among all predictive modeling approaches, machine learning
methods often achieve the highest prediction accuracy, but suffer from a
long-standing open problem precluding their widespread use in healthcare. Most
machine learning models give no explanation for their prediction results,
whereas interpretability is essential for a predictive model to be adopted in
typical healthcare settings. Methods: This paper presents the first complete
method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive
model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of
the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice
Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all
50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2
diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Results: For the champion machine
learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for
87.4% of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2
diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Conclusions: Our demonstration showed
the feasibility of automatically explaining results for any machine learning
predictive model without degrading accuracy.

    <summary>  Collecting sufficient labelled training data for health and medical problems
is difficult (Antropova, et al., 2018). Also, missing values are unavoidable in
health and medical datasets and tackling the problem arising from the
inadequate instances and missingness is not straightforward (Snell, et al.
2017, Sterne, et al. 2009). However, machine learning algorithms have achieved
significant success in many real-world healthcare problems, such as regression
and classification and these techniques could possibly be a way to resolve the
issues.

    <title>Privacy-Enhancing Technologies in Federated Learning for the Internet of
  Healthcare Things: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Advancements in wearable medical devices in IoT technology are shaping the
modern healthcare system. With the emergence of the Internet of Healthcare
Things (IoHT), we are witnessing how efficient healthcare services are provided
to patients and how healthcare professionals are effectively used AI-based
models to analyze the data collected from IoHT devices for the treatment of
various diseases. To avoid privacy breaches, these data must be processed and
analyzed in compliance with the legal rules and regulations such as HIPAA and
GDPR. Federated learning is a machine leaning based approach that allows
multiple entities to collaboratively train a ML model without sharing their
data. This is particularly useful in the healthcare domain where data privacy
and security are big concerns. Even though FL addresses some privacy concerns,
there is still no formal proof of privacy guarantees for IoHT data. Privacy
Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are a set of tools and techniques that are
designed to enhance the privacy and security of online communications and data
sharing. PETs provide a range of features that help protect users' personal
information and sensitive data from unauthorized access and tracking. This
paper reviews PETs in detail and comprehensively in relation to FL in the IoHT
setting and identifies several key challenges for future research.

    <title>Collaborative Graph Learning with Auxiliary Text for Temporal Event
  Prediction in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Accurate and explainable health event predictions are becoming crucial for
healthcare providers to develop care plans for patients. The availability of
electronic health records (EHR) has enabled machine learning advances in
providing these predictions. However, many deep learning based methods are not
satisfactory in solving several key challenges: 1) effectively utilizing
disease domain knowledge; 2) collaboratively learning representations of
patients and diseases; and 3) incorporating unstructured text. To address these
issues, we propose a collaborative graph learning model to explore
patient-disease interactions and medical domain knowledge. Our solution is able
to capture structural features of both patients and diseases. The proposed
model also utilizes unstructured text data by employing an attention regulation
strategy and then integrates attentive text features into a sequential learning
process. We conduct extensive experiments on two important healthcare problems
to show the competitive prediction performance of the proposed method compared
with various state-of-the-art models. We also confirm the effectiveness of
learned representations and model interpretability by a set of ablation and
case studies.

    <title>Explainability of Traditional and Deep Learning Models on Longitudinal
  Healthcare Records</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in deep learning have led to interest in training deep
learning models on longitudinal healthcare records to predict a range of
medical events, with models demonstrating high predictive performance.
Predictive performance is necessary but insufficient, however, with
explanations and reasoning from models required to convince clinicians for
sustained use. Rigorous evaluation of explainability is often missing, as
comparisons between models (traditional versus deep) and various explainability
methods have not been well-studied. Furthermore, ground truths needed to
evaluate explainability can be highly subjective depending on the clinician's
perspective. Our work is one of the first to evaluate explainability
performance between and within traditional (XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM
with Attention) models on both a global and individual per-prediction level on
longitudinal healthcare data. We compared explainability using three popular
methods: 1) SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), 2) Layer-Wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP), and 3) Attention. These implementations were applied on
synthetically generated datasets with designed ground-truths and a real-world
medicare claims dataset. We showed that overall, LSTMs with SHAP or LRP
provides superior explainability compared to XGBoost on both the global and
local level, while LSTM with dot-product attention failed to produce reasonable
ones. With the explosion of the volume of healthcare data and deep learning
progress, the need to evaluate explainability will be pivotal towards
successful adoption of deep learning models in healthcare settings.

    <title>Addressing Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks in Smart Healthcare
  Perspectives</title>
    <summary>  Smart healthcare systems are gaining popularity with the rapid development of
intelligent sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services,
and wireless communications. However, at the same time, several vulnerabilities
and adversarial attacks make it challenging for a safe and secure smart
healthcare system from a security point of view. Machine learning has been used
widely to develop suitable models to predict and mitigate attacks. Still, the
attacks could trick the machine learning models and misclassify outputs
generated by the model. As a result, it leads to incorrect decisions, for
example, false disease detection and wrong treatment plans for patients. In
this paper, we address the type of adversarial attacks and their impact on
smart healthcare systems. We propose a model to examine how adversarial attacks
impact machine learning classifiers. To test the model, we use a medical image
dataset. Our model can classify medical images with high accuracy. We then
attacked the model with a Fast Gradient Sign Method attack (FGSM) to cause the
model to predict the images and misclassify them inaccurately. Using transfer
learning, we train a VGG-19 model with the medical dataset and later implement
the FGSM to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to examine the significant
impact it causes on the performance and accuracy of the machine learning model.
Our results demonstrate that the adversarial attack misclassifies the images,
causing the model's accuracy rate to drop from 88% to 11%.

    <title>HTPS: Heterogeneous Transferring Prediction System for Healthcare
  Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Medical internet of things leads to revolutionary improvements in medical
services, also known as smart healthcare. With the big healthcare data, data
mining and machine learning can assist wellness management and intelligent
diagnosis, and achieve the P4-medicine. However, healthcare data has high
sparsity and heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous
Transferring Prediction System (HTPS). Feature engineering mechanism transforms
the dataset into sparse and dense feature matrices, and autoencoders in the
embedding networks not only embed features but also transfer knowledge from
heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed HTPS
outperforms the benchmark systems on various prediction tasks and datasets, and
ablation studies present the effectiveness of each designed mechanism.
Experimental results demonstrate the negative impact of heterogeneous data on
benchmark systems and the high transferability of the proposed HTPS.

    <title>Are Large Language Models Ready for Healthcare? A Comparative Study on
  Clinical Language Understanding</title>
    <summary>  Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various
domains, including healthcare. However, the specialized nature of clinical
language understanding tasks presents unique challenges and limitations that
warrant further investigation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard, within
the realm of clinical language understanding tasks. These tasks span a diverse
range, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, natural
language inference, semantic textual similarity, document classification, and
question-answering. We also introduce a novel prompting strategy,
self-questioning prompting (SQP), tailored to enhance LLMs' performance by
eliciting informative questions and answers pertinent to the clinical scenarios
at hand. Our evaluation underscores the significance of task-specific learning
strategies and prompting techniques for improving LLMs' effectiveness in
healthcare-related tasks. Additionally, our in-depth error analysis on the
challenging relation extraction task offers valuable insights into error
distribution and potential avenues for improvement using SQP. Our study sheds
light on the practical implications of employing LLMs in the specialized domain
of healthcare, serving as a foundation for future research and the development
of potential applications in healthcare settings.

    <title>Challenges for Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Many healthcare decisions involve navigating through a multitude of treatment
options in a sequential and iterative manner to find an optimal treatment
pathway with the goal of an optimal patient outcome. Such optimization problems
may be amenable to reinforcement learning. A reinforcement learning agent could
be trained to provide treatment recommendations for physicians, acting as a
decision support tool. However, a number of difficulties arise when using RL
beyond benchmark environments, such as specifying the reward function, choosing
an appropriate state representation and evaluating the learned policy.

    <title>SAIA: Split Artificial Intelligence Architecture for Mobile Healthcare
  System</title>
    <summary>  As the advancement of deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things and cloud
computing techniques for biomedical and healthcare problems, mobile healthcare
systems have received unprecedented attention. Since DL techniques usually
require enormous amount of computation, most of them cannot be directly
deployed on the resource-constrained mobile and IoT devices. Hence, most of the
mobile healthcare systems leverage the cloud computing infrastructure, where
the data collected by the mobile and IoT devices would be transmitted to the
cloud computing platforms for analysis. However, in the contested environments,
relying on the cloud might not be practical at all times. For instance, the
satellite communication might be denied or disrupted. We propose SAIA, a Split
Artificial Intelligence Architecture for mobile healthcare systems. Unlike
traditional approaches for artificial intelligence (AI) which solely exploits
the computational power of the cloud server, SAIA could not only relies on the
cloud computing infrastructure while the wireless communication is available,
but also utilizes the lightweight AI solutions that work locally on the client
side, hence, it can work even when the communication is impeded. In SAIA, we
propose a meta-information based decision unit, that could tune whether a
sample captured by the client should be operated by the embedded AI (i.e.,
keeping on the client) or the networked AI (i.e., sending to the server), under
different conditions. In our experimental evaluation, extensive experiments
have been conducted on two popular healthcare datasets. Our results show that
SAIA consistently outperforms its baselines in terms of both effectiveness and
efficiency.

    <title>CorGAN: Correlation-Capturing Convolutional Generative Adversarial
  Networks for Generating Synthetic Healthcare Records</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have demonstrated high-quality performance in areas such
as image classification and speech processing. However, creating a deep
learning model using electronic health record (EHR) data, requires addressing
particular privacy challenges that are unique to researchers in this domain.
This matter focuses attention on generating realistic synthetic data while
ensuring privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called
correlation-capturing Generative Adversarial Network (CorGAN), to generate
synthetic healthcare records. In CorGAN we utilize Convolutional Neural
Networks to capture the correlations between adjacent medical features in the
data representation space by combining Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Networks and Convolutional Autoencoders. To demonstrate the model fidelity, we
show that CorGAN generates synthetic data with performance similar to that of
real data in various Machine Learning settings such as classification and
prediction. We also give a privacy assessment and report on statistical
analysis regarding realistic characteristics of the synthetic data. The
software of this work is open-source and is available at:

    <title>Explainable AI for Fair Sepsis Mortality Predictive Model</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence supports healthcare professionals with predictive
modeling, greatly transforming clinical decision-making. This study addresses
the crucial need for fairness and explainability in AI applications within
healthcare to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient demographics. By
focusing on the predictive modeling of sepsis-related mortality, we propose a
method that learns a performance-optimized predictive model and then employs
the transfer learning process to produce a model with better fairness. Our
method also introduces a novel permutation-based feature importance algorithm
aiming at elucidating the contribution of each feature in enhancing fairness on
predictions. Unlike existing explainability methods concentrating on explaining
feature contribution to predictive performance, our proposed method uniquely
bridges the gap in understanding how each feature contributes to fairness. This
advancement is pivotal, given sepsis's significant mortality rate and its role
in one-third of hospital deaths. Our method not only aids in identifying and
mitigating biases within the predictive model but also fosters trust among
healthcare stakeholders by improving the transparency and fairness of model
predictions, thereby contributing to more equitable and trustworthy healthcare
delivery.

    <title>Does the "Artificial Intelligence Clinician" learn optimal treatment
  strategies for sepsis in intensive care?</title>
    <summary>  From 2017 to 2018 the number of scientific publications found via PubMed
search using the keyword "Machine Learning" increased by 46% (4,317 to 6,307).
The results of studies involving machine learning, artificial intelligence
(AI), and big data have captured the attention of healthcare practitioners,
healthcare managers, and the public at a time when Western medicine grapples
with unmitigated cost increases and public demands for accountability. The
complexity involved in healthcare applications of machine learning and the size
of the associated data sets has afforded many researchers an uncontested
opportunity to satisfy these demands with relatively little oversight. In a
recent Nature Medicine article, "The Artificial Intelligence Clinician learns
optimal treatment strategies for sepsis in intensive care," Komorowski and his
coauthors propose methods to train an artificial intelligence clinician to
treat sepsis patients with vasopressors and IV fluids. In this post, we will
closely examine the claims laid out in this paper. In particular, we will study
the individual treatment profiles suggested by their AI Clinician to gain
insight into how their AI Clinician intends to treat patients on an individual
level.

    <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using machine learning for
  Healthcare application: tutorial and benchmark</title>
    <summary>  Developing new drugs for target diseases is a time-consuming and expensive
task, drug repurposing has become a popular topic in the drug development
field. As much health claim data become available, many studies have been
conducted on the data. The real-world data is noisy, sparse, and has many
confounding factors. In addition, many studies have shown that drugs effects
are heterogeneous among the population. Lots of advanced machine learning
models about estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) have emerged in
recent years, and have been applied to in econometrics and machine learning
communities. These studies acknowledge medicine and drug development as the
main application area, but there has been limited translational research from
the HTE methodology to drug development. We aim to introduce the HTE
methodology to the healthcare area and provide feasibility consideration when
translating the methodology with benchmark experiments on healthcare
administrative claim data. Also, we want to use benchmark experiments to show
how to interpret and evaluate the model when it is applied to healthcare
research. By introducing the recent HTE techniques to a broad readership in
biomedical informatics communities, we expect to promote the wide adoption of
causal inference using machine learning. We also expect to provide the
feasibility of HTE for personalized drug effectiveness.

    <title>Directive Explanations for Monitoring the Risk of Diabetes Onset:
  Introducing Directive Data-Centric Explanations and Combinations to Support
  What-If Explorations</title>
    <summary>  Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly used in machine learning
(ML) based decision-making systems in healthcare. However, little research has
compared the utility of different explanation methods in guiding healthcare
experts for patient care. Moreover, it is unclear how useful, understandable,
actionable and trustworthy these methods are for healthcare experts, as they
often require technical ML knowledge. This paper presents an explanation
dashboard that predicts the risk of diabetes onset and explains those
predictions with data-centric, feature-importance, and example-based
explanations. We designed an interactive dashboard to assist healthcare
experts, such as nurses and physicians, in monitoring the risk of diabetes
onset and recommending measures to minimize risk. We conducted a qualitative
study with 11 healthcare experts and a mixed-methods study with 45 healthcare
experts and 51 diabetic patients to compare the different explanation methods
in our dashboard in terms of understandability, usefulness, actionability, and
trust. Results indicate that our participants preferred our representation of
data-centric explanations that provide local explanations with a global
overview over other methods. Therefore, this paper highlights the importance of
visually directive data-centric explanation method for assisting healthcare
experts to gain actionable insights from patient health records. Furthermore,
we share our design implications for tailoring the visual representation of
different explanation methods for healthcare experts.

    <title>A Review of Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Processing, and
  Applications in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful approach for tackling
complex medical decision-making problems such as treatment planning,
personalized medicine, and optimizing the scheduling of surgeries and
appointments. It has gained significant attention in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) due to its ability to learn optimal strategies for
tasks such as dialogue systems, machine translation, and question-answering.
This paper presents a review of the RL techniques in NLP, highlighting key
advancements, challenges, and applications in healthcare. The review begins by
visualizing a roadmap of machine learning and its applications in healthcare.
And then it explores the integration of RL with NLP tasks. We examined dialogue
systems where RL enables the learning of conversational strategies, RL-based
machine translation models, question-answering systems, text summarization, and
information extraction. Additionally, ethical considerations and biases in
RL-NLP systems are addressed.

    <title>Evaluating Fair Feature Selection in Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  With the universal adoption of machine learning in healthcare, the potential
for the automation of societal biases to further exacerbate health disparities
poses a significant risk. We explore algorithmic fairness from the perspective
of feature selection. Traditional feature selection methods identify features
for better decision making by removing resource-intensive, correlated, or
non-relevant features but overlook how these factors may differ across
subgroups. To counter these issues, we evaluate a fair feature selection method
that considers equal importance to all demographic groups. We jointly
considered a fairness metric and an error metric within the feature selection
process to ensure a balance between minimizing both bias and global
classification error. We tested our approach on three publicly available
healthcare datasets. On all three datasets, we observed improvements in
fairness metrics coupled with a minimal degradation of balanced accuracy. Our
approach addresses both distributive and procedural fairness within the fair
machine learning context.

    <title>FlexCare: Leveraging Cross-Task Synergy for Flexible Multimodal
  Healthcare Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data can offer a holistic
assessment of a patient's health status, supporting various predictive
healthcare tasks. Recently, several studies have embraced the multitask
learning approach in the healthcare domain, exploiting the inherent
correlations among clinical tasks to predict multiple outcomes simultaneously.
However, existing methods necessitate samples to possess complete labels for
all tasks, which places heavy demands on the data and restricts the flexibility
of the model. Meanwhile, within a multitask framework with multimodal inputs,
how to comprehensively consider the information disparity among modalities and
among tasks still remains a challenging problem. To tackle these issues, a
unified healthcare prediction model, also named by \textbf{FlexCare}, is
proposed to flexibly accommodate incomplete multimodal inputs, promoting the
adaption to multiple healthcare tasks. The proposed model breaks the
conventional paradigm of parallel multitask prediction by decomposing it into a
series of asynchronous single-task prediction. Specifically, a task-agnostic
multimodal information extraction module is presented to capture decorrelated
representations of diverse intra- and inter-modality patterns. Taking full
account of the information disparities between different modalities and
different tasks, we present a task-guided hierarchical multimodal fusion module
that integrates the refined modality-level representations into an individual
patient-level representation. Experimental results on multiple tasks from
MIMIC-IV/MIMIC-CXR/MIMIC-NOTE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Additionally, further analysis underscores the feasibility and
potential of employing such a multitask strategy in the healthcare domain. The
source code is available at https://github.com/mhxu1998/FlexCare.

    <title>Accu-Help: A Machine Learning based Smart Healthcare Framework for
  Accurate Detection of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</title>
    <summary>  In recent years the importance of Smart Healthcare cannot be overstated. The
current work proposed to expand the state-of-art of smart healthcare in
integrating solutions for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Identification
of OCD from oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs) using machine learning is an
important development in the study of OCD. However, this process involves the
collection of OCD class labels from hospitals, collection of corresponding OSBs
from biochemical laboratories, integrated and labeled dataset creation, use of
suitable machine learning algorithm for designing OCD prediction model, and
making these prediction models available for different biochemical laboratories
for OCD prediction for unlabeled OSBs. Further, from time to time, with
significant growth in the volume of the dataset with labeled samples,
redesigning the prediction model is required for further use. The whole process
requires distributed data collection, data integration, coordination between
the hospital and biochemical laboratory, dynamic machine learning OCD
prediction mode design using a suitable machine learning algorithm, and making
the machine learning model available for the biochemical laboratories. Keeping
all these things in mind, Accu-Help a fully automated, smart, and accurate OCD
detection conceptual model is proposed to help the biochemical laboratories for
efficient detection of OCD from OSBs. OSBs are classified into three classes:
Healthy Individual (HI), OCD Affected Individual (OAI), and Genetically
Affected Individual (GAI). The main component of this proposed framework is the
machine learning OCD prediction model design. In this Accu-Help, a neural
network-based approach is presented with an OCD prediction accuracy of 86
percent.

    <title>BPFISH: Blockchain and Privacy-preserving FL Inspired Smart Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes Federated Learning (FL) based smart healthcare system
where Medical Centers (MCs) train the local model using the data collected from
patients and send the model weights to the miners in a blockchain-based robust
framework without sharing raw data, keeping privacy preservation into
deliberation. We formulate an optimization problem by maximizing the utility
and minimizing the loss function considering energy consumption and FL process
delay of MCs for learning effective models on distributed healthcare data
underlying a blockchain-based framework. We propose a solution in two stages:
first, offer a stable matching-based association algorithm to maximize the
utility of both miners and MCs and then solve loss minimization using
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm employing FL under Differential
Privacy (DP) and blockchain technology. Moreover, we incorporate blockchain
technology to provide tempered resistant and decentralized model weight sharing
in the proposed FL-based framework. The effectiveness of the proposed model is
shown through simulation on real-world healthcare data comparing other
state-of-the-art techniques.

    <title>Intensive Care as One Big Sequence Modeling Problem</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare is typically concerned with narrow
self-contained tasks such as sepsis prediction or anesthesia control. However,
previous research has demonstrated the potential of generalist models (the
prime example being Large Language Models) to outperform task-specific
approaches due to their capability for implicit transfer learning. To enable
training of foundation models for Healthcare as well as leverage the
capabilities of state of the art Transformer architectures, we propose the
paradigm of Healthcare as Sequence Modeling, in which interaction between the
patient and the healthcare provider is represented as an event stream and tasks
like diagnosis and treatment selection are modeled as prediction of future
events in the stream. To explore this paradigm experimentally we develop
MIMIC-SEQ, a sequence modeling benchmark derived by translating heterogenous
clinical records from MIMIC-IV dataset into a uniform event stream format,
train a baseline model and explore its capabilities.

    <title>Towards Quantification of Bias in Machine Learning for Healthcare: A
  Case Study of Renal Failure Prediction</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning (ML) models, trained on real-world datasets, become
common practice, it is critical to measure and quantify their potential biases.
In this paper, we focus on renal failure and compare a commonly used
traditional risk score, Tangri, with a more powerful machine learning model,
which has access to a larger variable set and trained on 1.6 million patients'
EHR data. We will compare and discuss the generalization and applicability of
these two models, in an attempt to quantify biases of status quo clinical
practice, compared to ML-driven models.

    <title>Understanding racial bias in health using the Medical Expenditure Panel
  Survey data</title>
    <summary>  Over the years, several studies have demonstrated that there exist
significant disparities in health indicators in the United States population
across various groups. Healthcare expense is used as a proxy for health in
algorithms that drive healthcare systems and this exacerbates the existing
bias. In this work, we focus on the presence of racial bias in health
indicators in the publicly available, and nationally representative Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. We show that predictive models for care
management trained using this data inherit this bias. Finally, we demonstrate
that this inherited bias can be reduced significantly using simple mitigation
techniques.

    <title>Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes
  Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead</title>
    <summary>  Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high stakes
decision-making throughout society, causing problems throughout healthcare,
criminal justice, and in other domains. People have hoped that creating methods
for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of these problems,
but trying to \textit{explain} black box models, rather than creating models
that are \textit{interpretable} in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad
practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society. There is a
way forward -- it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This
manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using
inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable
black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges
to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications
where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in
criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.

    <title>Towards Compliant Data Management Systems for Healthcare ML</title>
    <summary>  The increasing popularity of machine learning approaches and the rising
awareness of data protection and data privacy presents an opportunity to build
truly secure and trustworthy healthcare systems. Regulations such as GDPR and
HIPAA present broad guidelines and frameworks, but the implementation can
present technical challenges. Compliant data management systems require
enforcement of a number of technical and administrative safeguards. While
policies can be set for both safeguards there is limited availability to
understand compliance in real time. Increasingly, machine learning
practitioners are becoming aware of the importance of keeping track of
sensitive data. With sensitivity over personally identifiable, health or
commercially sensitive information there would be value in understanding
assessment of the flow of data in a more dynamic fashion. We review how data
flows within machine learning projects in healthcare from source to storage to
use in training algorithms and beyond. Based on this, we design engineering
specifications and solutions for versioning of data. Our objective is to design
tools to detect and track sensitive data across machines and users across the
life cycle of a project, prioritizing efficiency, consistency and ease of use.
We build a prototype of the solution that demonstrates the difficulties in this
domain. Together, these represent first efforts towards building a compliant
data management system for healthcare machine learning projects.

    <title>Boosting Deep Learning Risk Prediction with Generative Adversarial
  Networks for Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  The rapid growth of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), as well as the
accompanied opportunities in Data-Driven Healthcare (DDH), has been attracting
widespread interests and attentions. Recent progress in the design and
applications of deep learning methods has shown promising results and is
forcing massive changes in healthcare academia and industry, but most of these
methods rely on massive labeled data. In this work, we propose a general deep
learning framework which is able to boost risk prediction performance with
limited EHR data. Our model takes a modified generative adversarial network
namely ehrGAN, which can provide plausible labeled EHR data by mimicking real
patient records, to augment the training dataset in a semi-supervised learning
manner. We use this generative model together with a convolutional neural
network (CNN) based prediction model to improve the onset prediction
performance. Experiments on two real healthcare datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework produces realistic data samples and achieves significant
improvements on classification tasks with the generated data over several
stat-of-the-art baselines.

    <title>Considerations for Visualizing Uncertainty in Clinical Machine Learning
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Clinician-facing predictive models are increasingly present in the healthcare
setting. Regardless of their success with respect to performance metrics, all
models have uncertainty. We investigate how to visually communicate uncertainty
in this setting in an actionable, trustworthy way. To this end, we conduct a
qualitative study with cardiac critical care clinicians. Our results reveal
that clinician trust may be impacted most not by the degree of uncertainty, but
rather by how transparent the visualization of what the sources of uncertainty
are. Our results show a clear connection between feature interpretability and
clinical actionability.

    <title>Exploring Contrastive Learning in Human Activity Recognition for
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) constitutes one of the most important tasks
for wearable and mobile sensing given its implications in human well-being and
health monitoring. Motivated by the limitations of labeled datasets in HAR,
particularly when employed in healthcare-related applications, this work
explores the adoption and adaptation of SimCLR, a contrastive learning
technique for visual representations, to HAR. The use of contrastive learning
objectives causes the representations of corresponding views to be more
similar, and those of non-corresponding views to be more different. After an
extensive evaluation exploring 64 combinations of different signal
transformations for augmenting the data, we observed significant performance
differences owing to the order and the function thereof. In particular,
preliminary results indicated an improvement over supervised and unsupervised
learning methods when using fine-tuning and random rotation for augmentation,
however, future work should explore under which conditions SimCLR is beneficial
for HAR systems and other healthcare-related applications.

    <title>A Brief Review of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  XAI refers to the techniques and methods for building AI applications which
assist end users to interpret output and predictions of AI models. Black box AI
applications in high-stakes decision-making situations, such as medical domain
have increased the demand for transparency and explainability since wrong
predictions may have severe consequences. Model explainability and
interpretability are vital successful deployment of AI models in healthcare
practices. AI applications' underlying reasoning needs to be transparent to
clinicians in order to gain their trust. This paper presents a systematic
review of XAI aspects and challenges in the healthcare domain. The primary
goals of this study are to review various XAI methods, their challenges, and
related machine learning models in healthcare. The methods are discussed under
six categories: Features-oriented methods, global methods, concept models,
surrogate models, local pixel-based methods, and human-centric methods. Most
importantly, the paper explores XAI role in healthcare problems to clarify its
necessity in safety-critical applications. The paper intends to establish a
comprehensive understanding of XAI-related applications in the healthcare field
by reviewing the related experimental results. To facilitate future research
for filling research gaps, the importance of XAI models from different
viewpoints and their limitations are investigated.

    <title>Progression and Challenges of IoT in Healthcare: A Short Review</title>
    <summary>  Smart healthcare, an integral element of connected living, plays a pivotal
role in fulfilling a fundamental human need. The burgeoning field of smart
healthcare is poised to generate substantial revenue in the foreseeable future.
Its multifaceted framework encompasses vital components such as the Internet of
Things (IoT), medical sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), edge and cloud
computing, as well as next-generation wireless communication technologies. Many
research papers discuss smart healthcare and healthcare more broadly. Numerous
nations have strategically deployed the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)
alongside other measures to combat the propagation of COVID-19. This combined
effort has not only enhanced the safety of frontline healthcare workers but has
also augmented the overall efficacy in managing the pandemic, subsequently
reducing its impact on human lives and mortality rates. Remarkable strides have
been made in both applications and technology within the IoMT domain. However,
it is imperative to acknowledge that this technological advancement has
introduced certain challenges, particularly in the realm of security. The rapid
and extensive adoption of IoMT worldwide has magnified issues related to
security and privacy. These encompass a spectrum of concerns, ranging from
replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation, privileged insider
threats, remote hijacking, password guessing, and denial of service (DoS)
attacks, to malware incursions. In this comprehensive review, we undertake a
comparative analysis of existing strategies designed for the detection and
prevention of malware in IoT environments.

    <title>Federated Learning for Healthcare Informatics</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid development of computer software and hardware technologies,
more and more healthcare data are becoming readily available from clinical
institutions, patients, insurance companies and pharmaceutical industries,
among others. This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data
science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of
care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private
making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example,
different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different
patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals
because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing
effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse,
"big data". Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model
with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local
institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the
fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this
survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly
within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions
to the statistical challenges, system challenges and privacy issues in
federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in
healthcare.

    <title>Fairness and Privacy in Federated Learning and Their Implications in
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Currently, many contexts exist where distributed learning is difficult or
otherwise constrained by security and communication limitations. One common
domain where this is a consideration is in Healthcare where data is often
governed by data-use-ordinances like HIPAA. On the other hand, larger sample
sizes and shared data models are necessary to allow models to better generalize
on account of the potential for more variability and balancing underrepresented
classes. Federated learning is a type of distributed learning model that allows
data to be trained in a decentralized manner. This, in turn, addresses data
security, privacy, and vulnerability considerations as data itself is not
shared across a given learning network nodes. Three main challenges to
federated learning include node data is not independent and identically
distributed (iid), clients requiring high levels of communication overhead
between peers, and there is the heterogeneity of different clients within a
network with respect to dataset bias and size. As the field has grown, the
notion of fairness in federated learning has also been introduced through novel
implementations. Fairness approaches differ from the standard form of federated
learning and also have distinct challenges and considerations for the
healthcare domain. This paper endeavors to outline the typical lifecycle of
fair federated learning in research as well as provide an updated taxonomy to
account for the current state of fairness in implementations. Lastly, this
paper provides added insight into the implications and challenges of
implementing and supporting fairness in federated learning in the healthcare
domain.

events such as pandemics (i.e. Covid-19) and natural disasters (such as
hurricanes and earthquakes). In most cases, such events lead to critical
uncertainties in decision making, as well as in multiple medical and economic
aspects at a hospital. External (geographic) or internal factors (medical and
managerial), lead to shifts in planning and budgeting, but most importantly,
reduces confidence in conventional processes. In some cases, support from other
hospitals proves necessary, which exacerbates the planning aspect. This
manuscript presents three data-driven methods that provide data-driven
indicators to help healthcare managers organize their economics and identify
the most optimum plan for resources allocation and sharing. Conventional
decision-making methods fall short in recommending validated policies for
managers. Using reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, traveling salesman,
and clustering, we experimented with different healthcare variables and
presented tools and outcomes that could be applied at health institutes.
Experiments are performed; the results are recorded, evaluated, and presented.

    <title>Shesop Healthcare: Stress and influenza classification using support
  vector machine kernel</title>
    <summary>  Shesop is an integrated system to make human lives more easily and to help
people in terms of healthcare. Stress and influenza classification is a part of
Shesop's application for a healthcare devices such as smartwatch, polar and
fitbit. The main objective of this paper is to classify a new data and inform
whether you are stress, depressed, caught by influenza or not. We will use the
heart rate data taken for months in Bandung, analyze the data and find the
Heart rate variance that constantly related with the stress and flu level.
After we found the variable, we will use the variable as an input to the
support vector machine learning. We will use the lagrangian and kernel
technique to transform 2D data into 3D data so we can use the linear
classification in 3D space. In the end, we could use the machine learning's
result to classify new data and get the final result immediately: stress or
not, influenza or not.

    <title>Variational Disentanglement for Rare Event Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Combining the increasing availability and abundance of healthcare data and
the current advances in machine learning methods have created renewed
opportunities to improve clinical decision support systems. However, in
healthcare risk prediction applications, the proportion of cases with the
condition (label) of interest is often very low relative to the available
sample size. Though very prevalent in healthcare, such imbalanced
classification settings are also common and challenging in many other
scenarios. So motivated, we propose a variational disentanglement approach to
semi-parametrically learn from rare events in heavily imbalanced classification
problems. Specifically, we leverage the imposed extreme-distribution behavior
on a latent space to extract information from low-prevalence events, and
develop a robust prediction arm that joins the merits of the generalized
additive model and isotonic neural nets. Results on synthetic studies and
diverse real-world datasets, including mortality prediction on a COVID-19
cohort, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing
alternatives.

    <title>Introducing L2M3, A Multilingual Medical Large Language Model to Advance
  Health Equity in Low-Resource Regions</title>
    <summary>  Addressing the imminent shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030,
predominantly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), this paper
introduces an innovative approach that harnesses the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) integrated with machine translation models. This solution is
engineered to meet the unique needs of Community Health Workers (CHWs),
overcoming language barriers, cultural sensitivities, and the limited
availability of medical dialog datasets. I have crafted a model that not only
boasts superior translation capabilities but also undergoes rigorous
fine-tuning on open-source datasets to ensure medical accuracy and is equipped
with comprehensive safety features to counteract the risks of misinformation.
  Featuring a modular design, this approach is specifically structured for
swift adaptation across various linguistic and cultural contexts, utilizing
open-source components to significantly reduce healthcare operational costs.
This strategic innovation markedly improves the accessibility and quality of
healthcare services by providing CHWs with contextually appropriate medical
knowledge and diagnostic tools. This paper highlights the transformative impact
of this context-aware LLM, underscoring its crucial role in addressing the
global healthcare workforce deficit and propelling forward healthcare outcomes
in LMICs.

    <title>Efficient Deep Learning on Multi-Source Private Data</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models benefit from large and diverse datasets. Using such
datasets, however, often requires trusting a centralized data aggregator. For
sensitive applications like healthcare and finance this is undesirable as it
could compromise patient privacy or divulge trade secrets. Recent advances in
secure and privacy-preserving computation, including trusted hardware enclaves
and differential privacy, offer a way for mutually distrusting parties to
efficiently train a machine learning model without revealing the training data.
In this work, we introduce Myelin, a deep learning framework which combines
these privacy-preservation primitives, and use it to establish a baseline level
of performance for fully private machine learning.

    <title>Revisiting Large Scale Distributed Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, with the widespread of smartphones and other portable gadgets
equipped with a variety of sensors, data is ubiquitous available and the focus
of machine learning has shifted from being able to infer from small training
samples to dealing with large scale high-dimensional data. In domains such as
personal healthcare applications, which motivates this survey, distributed
machine learning is a promising line of research, both for scaling up learning
algorithms, but mostly for dealing with data which is inherently produced at
different locations. This report offers a thorough overview of and
state-of-the-art algorithms for distributed machine learning, for both
supervised and unsupervised learning, ranging from simple linear logistic
regression to graphical models and clustering. We propose future directions for
most categories, specific to the potential personal healthcare applications.
With this in mind, the report focuses on how security and low communication
overhead can be assured in the specific case of a strictly client-server
architectural model. As particular directions we provides an exhaustive
presentation of an empirical clustering algorithm, k-windows, and proposed an
asynchronous distributed machine learning algorithm that would scale well and
also would be computationally cheap and easy to implement.

    <title>Federated Learning for Privacy Preservation in Smart Healthcare Systems:
  A Comprehensive Survey</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have
revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system
by using IoMT devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of
artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and wearable IoMT devices
raises privacy concerns with respect to the information that has been
communicated between hospitals and end users. The information conveyed by the
IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this
regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm has opened up new
opportunities for privacy-preservation in IoMT without accessing the
confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end
users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific
properties of FL, in this paper we present privacy related issues in IoMT.
Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation
and introduce some advanced FL architectures incorporating deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for
detecting privacy threats. Subsequently, we present some practical
opportunities of FL in smart healthcare systems. At the end, we conclude this
survey by providing open research challenges for FL that can be used in future
smart healthcare systems

    <title>Internet-of-Things Devices and Assistive Technologies for Healthcare:
  Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
    <summary>  Medical conditions and cases are growing at a rapid pace, where physical
space is starting to be constrained. Hospitals and clinics no longer have the
ability to accommodate large numbers of incoming patients. It is clear that the
current state of the health industry needs to improve its valuable and limited
resources. The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with
assistive technologies can alleviate the problem in healthcare, by being a
convenient and easy means of accessing healthcare services wirelessly. There is
a plethora of IoT devices and potential applications that can take advantage of
the unique characteristics that these technologies can offer. However, at the
same time, these services pose novel challenges that need to be properly
addressed. In this article, we review some popular categories of IoT-based
applications for healthcare along with their devices. Then, we describe the
challenges and discuss how research can properly address the open issues and
improve the already existing implementations in healthcare. Further possible
solutions are also discussed to show their potential in being viable solutions
for future healthcare applications

    <title>Transformers in Healthcare: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  With Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating various aspects of
society, including healthcare, the adoption of the Transformers neural network
architecture is rapidly changing many applications. Transformer is a type of
deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many
fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of
how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of data,
including medical imaging, structured and unstructured Electronic Health
Records (EHR), social media, physiological signals, and biomolecular sequences.
Those models could help in clinical diagnosis, report generation, data
reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. We identified relevant studies
using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of using
transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model
interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications,
and environmental impact.

    <title>Generating Synthetic but Plausible Healthcare Record Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Generating datasets that "look like" given real ones is an interesting tasks
for healthcare applications of ML and many other fields of science and
engineering. In this paper we propose a new method of general application to
binary datasets based on a method for learning the parameters of a latent
variable moment that we have previously used for clustering patient datasets.
We compare our method with a recent proposal (MedGan) based on generative
adversarial methods and find that the synthetic datasets we generate are
globally more realistic in at least two senses: real and synthetic instances
are harder to tell apart by Random Forests, and the MMD statistic. The most
likely explanation is that our method does not suffer from the "mode collapse"
which is an admitted problem of GANs. Additionally, the generative models we
generate are easy to interpret, unlike the rather obscure GANs. Our experiments
are performed on two patient datasets containing ICD-9 diagnostic codes: the
publicly available MIMIC-III dataset and a dataset containing admissions for
congestive heart failure during 7 years at Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona.

    <title>ModelChain: Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Predictive
  Modeling Framework on Private Blockchain Networks</title>
    <summary>  Cross-institutional healthcare predictive modeling can accelerate research
and facilitate quality improvement initiatives, and thus is important for
national healthcare delivery priorities. For example, a model that predicts
risk of re-admission for a particular set of patients will be more
generalizable if developed with data from multiple institutions. While
privacy-protecting methods to build predictive models exist, most are based on
a centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness
vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure (and single-point-of-breach)
and accidental or malicious modification of records. In this article, we
describe a new framework, ModelChain, to adapt Blockchain technology for
privacy-preserving machine learning. Each participating site contributes to
model parameter estimation without revealing any patient health information
(i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across
institutions). We integrate privacy-preserving online machine learning with a
private Blockchain network, apply transaction metadata to disseminate partial
models, and design a new proof-of-information algorithm to determine the order
of the online learning process. We also discuss the benefits and potential
issues of applying Blockchain technology to solve the privacy-preserving
healthcare predictive modeling task and to increase interoperability between
institutions, to support the Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap and national
healthcare delivery priorities such as Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
(PCOR).

    <title>HITA: An Architecture for System-level Testing of Healthcare IoT
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  System-level testing of healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) applications
requires creating a test infrastructure with integrated medical devices and
third-party applications. A significant challenge in creating such test
infrastructure is that healthcare IoT applications evolve continuously with the
addition of new medical devices from different vendors and new services offered
by different third-party organizations following different architectures.
Moreover, creating test infrastructure with a large number of different types
of medical devices is time-consuming, financially expensive, and practically
infeasible. Oslo City's healthcare department faced these challenges while
working with various healthcare IoT applications. To address these challenges,
this paper presents a real-world test infrastructure software architecture
(HITA) designed for healthcare IoT applications. We evaluated HITA's digital
twin (DT) generation component implemented using model-based and machine
learning (ML) approaches in terms of DT fidelity, scalability, and time cost of
generating DTs. Results show that the fidelity of DTs created using model-based
and ML approaches reach 94% and 95%, respectively. Results from operating 100
DTs concurrently show that the DT generation component is scalable and ML-based
DTs have a higher time cost.

    <title>A tutorial on fairness in machine learning in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  $\textbf{OBJECTIVE}$: Ensuring that machine learning (ML) algorithms are safe
and effective within all patient groups, and do not disadvantage particular
patients, is essential to clinical decision making and preventing the
reinforcement of existing healthcare inequities. The objective of this tutorial
is to introduce the medical informatics community to the common notions of
fairness within ML, focusing on clinical applications and implementation in
practice.
  $\textbf{TARGET AUDIENCE}$: As gaps in fairness arise in a variety of
healthcare applications, this tutorial is designed to provide an understanding
of fairness, without assuming prior knowledge, to researchers and clinicians
who make use of modern clinical data.
  $\textbf{SCOPE}$: We describe the fundamental concepts and methods used to
define fairness in ML, including an overview of why models in healthcare may be
unfair, a summary and comparison of the metrics used to quantify fairness, and
a discussion of some ongoing research. We illustrate some of the fairness
methods introduced through a case study of mortality prediction in a publicly
available electronic health record dataset. Finally, we provide a user-friendly
R package for comprehensive group fairness evaluation, enabling researchers and
clinicians to assess fairness in their own ML work.

    <title>Open Challenges and Opportunities in Federated Foundation Models Towards
  Biomedical Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in
artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning
(FL) for advancing biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT,
LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including
unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements
in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text
and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require
processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and
multimodal patient interactions.
  The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising
strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of
sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs
in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical
concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the
current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges,
and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data
diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The
objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs
and FL, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking healthcare innovations.

    <title>The Significance of Machine Learning in Clinical Disease Diagnosis: A
  Review</title>
    <summary>  The global need for effective disease diagnosis remains substantial, given
the complexities of various disease mechanisms and diverse patient symptoms. To
tackle these challenges, researchers, physicians, and patients are turning to
machine learning (ML), an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline, to develop
solutions. By leveraging sophisticated ML and AI methods, healthcare
stakeholders gain enhanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities. However,
there is a scarcity of research focused on ML algorithms for enhancing the
accuracy and computational efficiency. This research investigates the capacity
of machine learning algorithms to improve the transmission of heart rate data
in time series healthcare metrics, concentrating particularly on optimizing
accuracy and efficiency. By exploring various ML algorithms used in healthcare
applications, the review presents the latest trends and approaches in ML-based
disease diagnosis (MLBDD). The factors under consideration include the
algorithm utilized, the types of diseases targeted, the data types employed,
the applications, and the evaluation metrics. This review aims to shed light on
the prospects of ML in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis. By
analyzing the current literature, the study provides insights into
state-of-the-art methodologies and their performance metrics.

    <title>Advancing Community Engaged Approaches to Identifying Structural Drivers
  of Racial Bias in Health Diagnostic Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of
machine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to
perpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial
system dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at
MIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in
building capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal
issues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and
implications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation
modeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling
process and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and
healthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and
recognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective
memory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and
negative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking
treatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and
quality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate
initial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of
focusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health
outcomes for some groups.

    <title>Model Selection for Offline Reinforcement Learning: Practical
  Considerations for Healthcare Settings</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn treatment policies and aid
decision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over
complex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g.,
deep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and
improve policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline
for model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual
environment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work,
we investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on
off-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present
an in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional
hyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary
models) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility
of different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context
of learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we
considered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation
ranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between
accuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage
approach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary
computation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model
selection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world
datasets. To facilitate reproducibility and future extensions, the code
accompanying this paper is available online at

    <title>A Review of Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning for Health</title>
    <summary>  Modern electronic health records (EHRs) provide data to answer clinically
meaningful questions. The growing data in EHRs makes healthcare ripe for the
use of machine learning. However, learning in a clinical setting presents
unique challenges that complicate the use of common machine learning
methodologies. For example, diseases in EHRs are poorly labeled, conditions can
encompass multiple underlying endotypes, and healthy individuals are
underrepresented. This article serves as a primer to illuminate these
challenges and highlights opportunities for members of the machine learning
community to contribute to healthcare.

    <title>FedHealth 2: Weighted Federated Transfer Learning via Batch
  Normalization for Personalized Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The success of machine learning applications often needs a large quantity of
data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is attracting increasing attention due
to the demand for data privacy and security, especially in the medical field.
However, the performance of existing FL approaches often deteriorates when
there exist domain shifts among clients, and few previous works focus on
personalization in healthcare. In this article, we propose FedHealth 2, an
extension of FedHealth \cite{chen2020fedhealth} to tackle domain shifts and get
personalized models for local clients. FedHealth 2 obtains the client
similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models
with preserving local batch normalization. Wearable activity recognition and
COVID-19 auxiliary diagnosis experiments have evaluated that FedHealth 2 can
achieve better accuracy (10%+ improvement for activity recognition) and
personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security.

    <title>iCardo: A Machine Learning Based Smart Healthcare Framework for
  Cardiovascular Disease Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The point of care services and medication have become simpler with efficient
consumer electronics devices in a smart healthcare system. Cardiovascular
disease is a critical illness which causes heart failure, and early and prompt
identification can lessen damage and prevent premature mortality. Machine
learning has been used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the
literature. The article explains choosing the best classifier model for the
selected feature sets and the distinct feature sets selected using four feature
selection models. The paper compares seven classifiers using each of the
sixteen feature sets. Originally, the data had 56 attributes and 303
occurrences, of which 87 were in good health, and the remainder had
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Demographic data with several features make up
the four groups of overall features. Lasso, Tree-based algorithms, Chi-Square
and RFE have all been used to choose the four distinct feature sets, each
containing five, ten, fifteen, and twenty features, respectively. Seven
distinct classifiers have been trained and evaluated for each of the sixteen
feature sets. To determine the most effective blend of feature set and model, a
total of 112 models have been trained, tested, and their performance has been
compared. SVM classifier with fifteen chosen features is shown to be the best
in terms of overall accuracy. The healthcare data has been maintained in the
cloud and would be accessible to patients, caretakers, and healthcare providers
through integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled smart
healthcare. Subsequently, the feature selection model chooses the most
appropriate feature for CVD prediction to calibrate the system, and the
proposed framework can be utilised to anticipate CVD.

    <title>Blockchain-based Federated Learning with SMPC Model Verification Against
  Poisoning Attack for Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  Due to the rising awareness of privacy and security in machine learning
applications, federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention and
applied to several areas, e.g., intelligence healthcare systems, IoT-based
industries, and smart cities. FL enables clients to train a global model
collaboratively without accessing their local training data. However, the
current FL schemes are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Its architecture
makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates difficult. In
addition, most recent studies to detect FL from malicious updates while
maintaining the model's privacy have not been sufficiently explored. This paper
proposed blockchain-based federated learning with SMPC model verification
against poisoning attacks for healthcare systems. First, we check the machine
learning model from the FL participants through an encrypted inference process
and remove the compromised model. Once the participants' local models have been
verified, the models are sent to the blockchain node to be securely aggregated.
We conducted several experiments with different medical datasets to evaluate
our proposed framework.

    <title>FLICU: A Federated Learning Workflow for Intensive Care Unit Mortality
  Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Although Machine Learning (ML) can be seen as a promising tool to improve
clinical decision-making for supporting the improvement of medication plans,
clinical procedures, diagnoses, or medication prescriptions, it remains limited
by access to healthcare data. Healthcare data is sensitive, requiring strict
privacy practices, and typically stored in data silos, making traditional
machine learning challenging. Federated learning can counteract those
limitations by training machine learning models over data silos while keeping
the sensitive data localized. This study proposes a federated learning workflow
for ICU mortality prediction. Hereby, the applicability of federated learning
as an alternative to centralized machine learning and local machine learning is
investigated by introducing federated learning to the binary classification
problem of predicting ICU mortality. We extract multivariate time series data
from the MIMIC-III database (lab values and vital signs), and benchmark the
predictive performance of four deep sequential classifiers (FRNN, LSTM, GRU,
and 1DCNN) varying the patient history window lengths (8h, 16h, 24h, 48h) and
the number of FL clients (2, 4, 8). The experiments demonstrate that both
centralized machine learning and federated learning are comparable in terms of
AUPRC and F1-score. Furthermore, the federated approach shows superior
performance over local machine learning. Thus, the federated approach can be
seen as a valid and privacy-preserving alternative to centralized machine
learning for classifying ICU mortality when sharing sensitive patient data
between hospitals is not possible.

    <title>Split Learning for collaborative deep learning in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Shortage of labeled data has been holding the surge of deep learning in
healthcare back, as sample sizes are often small, patient information cannot be
shared openly, and multi-center collaborative studies are a burden to set up.
Distributed machine learning methods promise to mitigate these problems. We
argue for a split learning based approach and apply this distributed learning
method for the first time in the medical field to compare performance against
(1) centrally hosted and (2) non collaborative configurations for a range of
participants. Two medical deep learning tasks are used to compare split
learning to conventional single and multi center approaches: a binary
classification problem of a data set of 9000 fundus photos, and multi-label
classification problem of a data set of 156,535 chest X-rays. The several
distributed learning setups are compared for a range of 1-50 distributed
participants. Performance of the split learning configuration remained constant
for any number of clients compared to a single center study, showing a marked
difference compared to the non collaborative configuration after 2 clients (p &lt;
0.001) for both sets. Our results affirm the benefits of collaborative training
of deep neural networks in health care. Our work proves the significant benefit
of distributed learning in healthcare, and paves the way for future real-world
implementations.

    <title>Emotion Recognition for Healthcare Surveillance Systems Using Neural
  Networks: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Recognizing the patient's emotions using deep learning techniques has
attracted significant attention recently due to technological advancements.
Automatically identifying the emotions can help build smart healthcare centers
that can detect depression and stress among the patients in order to start the
medication early. Using advanced technology to identify emotions is one of the
most exciting topics as it defines the relationships between humans and
machines. Machines learned how to predict emotions by adopting various methods.
In this survey, we present recent research in the field of using neural
networks to recognize emotions. We focus on studying emotions' recognition from
speech, facial expressions, and audio-visual input and show the different
techniques of deploying these algorithms in the real world. These three emotion
recognition techniques can be used as a surveillance system in healthcare
centers to monitor patients. We conclude the survey with a presentation of the
challenges and the related future work to provide an insight into the
applications of using emotion recognition.

    <title>Collaborative Federated Learning For Healthcare: Multi-Modal COVID-19
  Diagnosis at the Edge</title>
    <summary>  Despite significant improvements over the last few years, cloud-based
healthcare applications continue to suffer from poor adoption due to their
limitations in meeting stringent security, privacy, and quality of service
requirements (such as low latency). The edge computing trend, along with
techniques for distributed machine learning such as federated learning, have
gained popularity as a viable solution in such settings. In this paper, we
leverage the capabilities of edge computing in medicine by analyzing and
evaluating the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data at
the edge allowing the remote healthcare centers, lacking advanced diagnostic
facilities, to benefit from the multi-modal data securely. To this aim, we
utilize the emerging concept of clustered federated learning (CFL) for an
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Such an automated system can help reduce the
burden on healthcare systems across the world that has been under a lot of
stress since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework under different experimental setups on
two benchmark datasets. Promising results are obtained on both datasets
resulting in comparable results against the central baseline where the
specialized models (i.e., each on a specific type of COVID-19 imagery) are
trained with central data, and improvements of 16\% and 11\% in overall
F1-Scores have been achieved over the multi-modal model trained in the
conventional Federated Learning setup on X-ray and Ultrasound datasets,
respectively. We also discuss in detail the associated challenges,
technologies, tools, and techniques available for deploying ML at the edge in
such privacy and delay-sensitive applications.

    <title>From Explainable to Interpretable Deep Learning for Natural Language
  Processing in Healthcare: How Far from Reality?</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing
(NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based
NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least
explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough
scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term
"eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to
distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on
their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global).
Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging
IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major
challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling
processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation
and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to
enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL
with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of
XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In
conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise.
Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to
ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist,
XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in
healthcare.

    <title>Evaluating Progress on Machine Learning for Longitudinal Electronic
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  The Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge based on the well-known Imagenet
dataset catalyzed an intense flurry of progress in computer vision. Benchmark
tasks have propelled other sub-fields of machine learning forward at an equally
impressive pace, but in healthcare it has primarily been image processing
tasks, such as in dermatology and radiology, that have experienced similar
benchmark-driven progress. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive
review of benchmarks in medical machine learning for structured data,
identifying one based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care
(MIMIC-III) that allows the first direct comparison of predictive performance
and thus the evaluation of progress on four clinical prediction tasks:
mortality, length of stay, phenotyping, and patient decompensation. We find
that little meaningful progress has been made over a 3 year period on these
tasks, despite significant community engagement. Through our meta-analysis, we
find that the performance of deep recurrent models is only superior to logistic
regression on certain tasks. We conclude with a synthesis of these results,
possible explanations, and a list of desirable qualities for future benchmarks
in medical machine learning.

    <title>ISTHMUS: Secure, Scalable, Real-time and Robust Machine Learning
  Platform for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In recent times, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based
systems have evolved and scaled across different industries such as finance,
retail, insurance, energy utilities, etc. Among other things, they have been
used to predict patterns of customer behavior, to generate pricing models, and
to predict the return on investments. But the successes in deploying machine
learning models at scale in those industries have not translated into the
healthcare setting. There are multiple reasons why integrating ML models into
healthcare has not been widely successful, but from a technical perspective,
general-purpose commercial machine learning platforms are not a good fit for
healthcare due to complexities in handling data quality issues, mandates to
demonstrate clinical relevance, and a lack of ability to monitor performance in
a highly regulated environment with stringent security and privacy needs. In
this paper, we describe Isthmus, a turnkey, cloud-based platform which
addresses the challenges above and reduces time to market for operationalizing
ML/AI in healthcare. Towards the end, we describe three case studies which shed
light on Isthmus capabilities. These include (1) supporting an end-to-end
lifecycle of a model which predicts trauma survivability at hospital trauma
centers, (2) bringing in and harmonizing data from disparate sources to create
a community data platform for inferring population as well as patient level
insights for Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), and (3) ingesting
live-streaming data from various IoT sensors to build models, which can
leverage real-time and longitudinal information to make advanced time-sensitive
predictions.

    <title>An AI-Guided Data Centric Strategy to Detect and Mitigate Biases in
  Healthcare Datasets</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of diagnosis and prognostic algorithms in healthcare has led to
concerns about the perpetuation of bias against disadvantaged groups of
individuals. Deep learning methods to detect and mitigate bias have revolved
around modifying models, optimization strategies, and threshold calibration
with varying levels of success. Here, we generate a data-centric,
model-agnostic, task-agnostic approach to evaluate dataset bias by
investigating the relationship between how easily different groups are learned
at small sample sizes (AEquity). We then apply a systematic analysis of AEq
values across subpopulations to identify and mitigate manifestations of racial
bias in two known cases in healthcare - Chest X-rays diagnosis with deep
convolutional neural networks and healthcare utilization prediction with
multivariate logistic regression. AEq is a novel and broadly applicable metric
that can be applied to advance equity by diagnosing and remediating bias in
healthcare datasets.

  Systematic Review to Proposed Responsible Clinician-AI-Collaboration
  Framework</title>
    <summary>  This paper explores the significant impact of AI-based medical devices,
including wearables, telemedicine, large language models, and digital twins, on
clinical decision support systems. It emphasizes the importance of producing
outcomes that are not only accurate but also interpretable and understandable
to clinicians, addressing the risk that lack of interpretability poses in terms
of mistrust and reluctance to adopt these technologies in healthcare. The paper
reviews interpretable AI processes, methods, applications, and the challenges
of implementation in healthcare, focusing on quality control to facilitate
responsible communication between AI systems and clinicians. It breaks down the
interpretability process into data pre-processing, model selection, and
post-processing, aiming to foster a comprehensive understanding of the crucial
role of a robust interpretability approach in healthcare and to guide future
research in this area. with insights for creating responsible clinician-AI
tools for healthcare, as well as to offer a deeper understanding of the
challenges they might face. Our research questions, eligibility criteria and
primary goals were identified using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline and PICO method; PubMed, Scopus and Web of
Science databases were systematically searched using sensitive and specific
search strings. In the end, 52 publications were selected for data extraction
which included 8 existing reviews and 44 related experimental studies. The
paper offers general concepts of interpretable AI in healthcare and discuss
three-levels interpretability process. Additionally, it provides a
comprehensive discussion of evaluating robust interpretability AI in
healthcare. Moreover, this survey introduces a step-by-step roadmap for
implementing responsible AI in healthcare.

    <title>How to Train Your CheXDragon: Training Chest X-Ray Models for Transfer
  to Novel Tasks and Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables label efficient training for machine
learning models. This is essential for domains such as medical imaging, where
labels are costly and time-consuming to curate. However, the most effective
supervised or SSL strategy for transferring models to different healthcare
systems or novel tasks is not well understood. In this work, we systematically
experiment with a variety of supervised and self-supervised pretraining
strategies using multimodal datasets of medical images (chest X-rays) and text
(radiology reports). We then evaluate their performance on data from two
external institutions with diverse sets of tasks. In addition, we experiment
with different transfer learning strategies to effectively adapt these
pretrained models to new tasks and healthcare systems. Our empirical results
suggest that multimodal SSL gives substantial gains over unimodal SSL in
performance across new healthcare systems and tasks, comparable to models
pretrained with full supervision. We demonstrate additional performance gains
with models further adapted to the new dataset and task, using multimodal
domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), linear probing then finetuning (LP-FT), and
both methods combined. We offer suggestions for alternative models to use in
scenarios where not all of these additions are feasible. Our results provide
guidance for improving the generalization of medical image interpretation
models to new healthcare systems and novel tasks.

    <title>Methodology to Create Analysis-Naive Holdout Records as well as Train
  and Test Records for Machine Learning Analyses in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  It is common for researchers to holdout data from a study pool to be used for
external validation as well as for future research, and the same desire is true
to those using machine learning modeling research. For this discussion, the
purpose of the holdout sample it is preserve data for research studies that
will be analysis-naive and randomly selected from the full dataset.
Analysis-naive are records that are not used for testing or training machine
learning (ML) models and records that do not participate in any aspect of the
current machine learning study. The methodology suggested for creating holdouts
is a modification of k-fold cross validation, which takes into account
randomization and efficiently allows a three-way split (holdout, test and
training) as part of the method without forcing. The paper also provides a
working example using set of automated functions in Python and some scenarios
for applicability in healthcare.

    <title>Bi-directional personalization reinforcement learning-based architecture
  with active learning using a multi-model data service for the travel nursing
  industry</title>
    <summary>  The challenges of using inadequate online recruitment systems can be
addressed with machine learning and software engineering techniques.
Bi-directional personalization reinforcement learning-based architecture with
active learning can get recruiters to recommend qualified applicants and also
enable applicants to receive personalized job recommendations. This paper
focuses on how machine learning techniques can enhance the recruitment process
in the travel nursing industry by helping speed up data acquisition using a
multi-model data service and then providing personalized recommendations using
bi-directional reinforcement learning with active learning. This need was
especially evident when trying to respond to the overwhelming needs of
healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for traveling
nurses and other healthcare professionals was more evident during the lockdown
period. A data service was architected for job feed processing using an
orchestration of natural language processing (NLP) models that synthesize
job-related data into a database efficiently and accurately. The multi-model
data service provided the data necessary to develop a bi-directional
personalization system using reinforcement learning with active learning that
could recommend travel nurses and healthcare professionals to recruiters and
provide job recommendations to applicants using an internally developed smart
match score as a basis. The bi-directional personalization reinforcement
learning-based architecture with active learning combines two personalization
systems - one that runs forward to recommend qualified candidates for jobs and
another that runs backward and recommends jobs for applicants.

    <title>MiME: Multilevel Medical Embedding of Electronic Health Records for
  Predictive Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models exhibit state-of-the-art performance for many predictive
healthcare tasks using electronic health records (EHR) data, but these models
typically require training data volume that exceeds the capacity of most
healthcare systems. External resources such as medical ontologies are used to
bridge the data volume constraint, but this approach is often not directly
applicable or useful because of inconsistencies with terminology. To solve the
data insufficiency challenge, we leverage the inherent multilevel structure of
EHR data and, in particular, the encoded relationships among medical codes. We
propose Multilevel Medical Embedding (MiME) which learns the multilevel
embedding of EHR data while jointly performing auxiliary prediction tasks that
rely on this inherent EHR structure without the need for external labels. We
conducted two prediction tasks, heart failure prediction and sequential disease
prediction, where MiME outperformed baseline methods in diverse evaluation
settings. In particular, MiME consistently outperformed all baselines when
predicting heart failure on datasets of different volumes, especially
demonstrating the greatest performance improvement (15% relative gain in PR-AUC
over the best baseline) on the smallest dataset, demonstrating its ability to
effectively model the multilevel structure of EHR data.

    <title>ConCare: Personalized Clinical Feature Embedding via Capturing the
  Healthcare Context</title>
    <summary>  Predicting the patient's clinical outcome from the historical electronic
medical records (EMR) is a fundamental research problem in medical informatics.
Most deep learning-based solutions for EMR analysis concentrate on learning the
clinical visit embedding and exploring the relations between visits. Although
those works have shown superior performances in healthcare prediction, they
fail to explore the personal characteristics during the clinical visits
thoroughly. Moreover, existing works usually assume that the more recent record
weights more in the prediction, but this assumption is not suitable for all
conditions. In this paper, we propose ConCare to handle the irregular EMR data
and extract feature interrelationship to perform individualized healthcare
prediction. Our solution can embed the feature sequences separately by modeling
the time-aware distribution. ConCare further improves the multi-head
self-attention via the cross-head decorrelation, so that the inter-dependencies
among dynamic features and static baseline information can be effectively
captured to form the personal health context. Experimental results on two
real-world EMR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ConCare. The medical
findings extracted by ConCare are also empirically confirmed by human experts
and medical literature.

    <title>A Huber loss-based super learner with applications to healthcare
  expenditures</title>
    <summary>  Complex distributions of the healthcare expenditure pose challenges to
statistical modeling via a single model. Super learning, an ensemble method
that combines a range of candidate models, is a promising alternative for cost
estimation and has shown benefits over a single model. However, standard
approaches to super learning may have poor performance in settings where
extreme values are present, such as healthcare expenditure data. We propose a
super learner based on the Huber loss, a "robust" loss function that combines
squared error loss with absolute loss to down-weight the influence of outliers.
We derive oracle inequalities that establish bounds on the finite-sample and
asymptotic performance of the method. We show that the proposed method can be
used both directly to optimize Huber risk, as well as in finite-sample settings
where optimizing mean squared error is the ultimate goal. For this latter
scenario, we provide two methods for performing a grid search for values of the
robustification parameter indexing the Huber loss. Simulations and real data
analysis demonstrate appreciable finite-sample gains in cost prediction and
causal effect estimation using our proposed method.

    <title>m-TSNE: A Framework for Visualizing High-Dimensional Multivariate Time
  Series</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time series (MTS) have become increasingly common in healthcare
domains where human vital signs and laboratory results are collected for
predictive diagnosis. Recently, there have been increasing efforts to visualize
healthcare MTS data based on star charts or parallel coordinates. However, such
techniques might not be ideal for visualizing a large MTS dataset, since it is
difficult to obtain insights or interpretations due to the inherent high
dimensionality of MTS. In this paper, we propose 'm-TSNE': a simple and novel
framework to visualize high-dimensional MTS data by projecting them into a
low-dimensional (2-D or 3-D) space while capturing the underlying data
properties. Our framework is easy to use and provides interpretable insights
for healthcare professionals to understand MTS data. We evaluate our
visualization framework on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that the
results of our m-TSNE show patterns that are easy to understand while the other
methods' visualization may have limitations in interpretability.

    <title>The Transformation of Patient-Clinician Relationships With AI-Based
  Medical Advice: A "Bring Your Own Algorithm" Era in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  One of the dramatic trends at the intersection of computing and healthcare
has been patients' increased access to medical information, ranging from
self-tracked physiological data to genetic data, tests, and scans. Increasingly
however, patients and clinicians have access to advanced machine learning-based
tools for diagnosis, prediction, and recommendation based on large amounts of
data, some of it patient-generated. Consequently, just as organizations have
had to deal with a "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) reality in which employees
use their personal devices (phones and tablets) for some aspects of their work,
a similar reality of "Bring Your Own Algorithm" (BYOA) is emerging in
healthcare with its own challenges and support demands. BYOA is changing
patient-clinician interactions and the technologies, skills and workflows
related to them. In this paper we argue that: (1) BYOA is changing the
patient-clinician relationship and the nature of expert work in healthcare, and
(2) better patient-clinician-information-interpretation relationships can be
facilitated with solutions that integrate technological and organizational
perspectives.

    <title>Multi-task Prediction of Patient Workload</title>
    <summary>  Developing reliable workload predictive models can affect many aspects of
clinical decision making procedure. The primary challenge in healthcare systems
is handling the demand uncertainty over the time. This issue becomes more
critical for the healthcare facilities that provide service for chronic disease
treatment because of the need for continuous treatments over the time. Although
some researchers focused on exploring the methods for workload prediction
recently, few types of research mainly focused on forecasting a quantitative
measure for the workload of healthcare providers. Also, among the mentioned
studies most of them just focused on workload prediction within one facility.
The drawback of the previous studies is the problem is not investigated for
multiple facilities where the quality of provided service, the equipment, and
resources used for provided service as well as the diagnosis and treatment
procedures may differ even for patients with similar conditions. To tackle the
mentioned issue, this paper suggests a framework for patient workload
prediction by using patients data from VA facilities across the US. To capture
the information of patients with similar attributes and make the prediction
more accurate, a heuristic cluster based algorithm for single task learning as
well as a multi task learning approach are developed in this research.

    <title>Anticipatory Mobile Digital Health: Towards Personalised Proactive
  Therapies and Prevention Strategies</title>
    <summary>  The last two centuries saw groundbreaking advances in the field of
healthcare: from the invention of the vaccine to organ transplant, and
eradication of numerous deadly diseases. Yet, these breakthroughs have only
illuminated the role that individual traits and behaviours play in the health
state of a person. Continuous patient monitoring and individually-tailored
therapies can help in early detection and efficient tackling of health issues.
However, even the most developed nations cannot afford proactive personalised
healthcare at scale. Mobile computing devices, nowadays equipped with an array
of sensors, high-performance computing power, and carried by their owners at
all time, promise to revolutionise modern healthcare. These devices can enable
continuous patient monitoring, and, with the help of machine learning, can
build predictive models of patient's health and behaviour. Finally, through
their close integration with a user's lifestyle mobiles can be used to deliver
personalised proactive therapies. In this article, we develop the concept of
anticipatory mobile-based healthcare - anticipatory mobile digital health - and
examine the opportunities and challenges associated with its practical
realisation.

    <title>GraphCare: Enhancing Healthcare Predictions with Personalized Knowledge
  Graphs</title>
    <summary>  Clinical predictive models often rely on patients' electronic health records
(EHR), but integrating medical knowledge to enhance predictions and
decision-making is challenging. This is because personalized predictions
require personalized knowledge graphs (KGs), which are difficult to generate
from patient EHR data. To address this, we propose \textsc{GraphCare}, an
open-world framework that uses external KGs to improve EHR-based predictions.
Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external
biomedical KGs to build patient-specific KGs, which are then used to train our
proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare
predictions. On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, \textsc{GraphCare}
surpasses baselines in four vital healthcare prediction tasks: mortality,
readmission, length of stay (LOS), and drug recommendation. On MIMIC-III, it
boosts AUROC by 17.6\% and 6.6\% for mortality and readmission, and F1-score by
7.9\% and 10.8\% for LOS and drug recommendation, respectively. Notably,
\textsc{GraphCare} demonstrates a substantial edge in scenarios with limited
data availability. Our findings highlight the potential of using external KGs
in healthcare prediction tasks and demonstrate the promise of
\textsc{GraphCare} in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized
medicine.

    <title>An Unsupervised Approach to Achieve Supervised-Level Explainability in
  Healthcare Records</title>
    <summary>  Electronic healthcare records are vital for patient safety as they document
conditions, plans, and procedures in both free text and medical codes. Language
models have significantly enhanced the processing of such records, streamlining
workflows and reducing manual data entry, thereby saving healthcare providers
significant resources. However, the black-box nature of these models often
leaves healthcare professionals hesitant to trust them. State-of-the-art
explainability methods increase model transparency but rely on human-annotated
evidence spans, which are costly. In this study, we propose an approach to
produce plausible and faithful explanations without needing such annotations.
We demonstrate on the automated medical coding task that adversarial robustness
training improves explanation plausibility and introduce AttInGrad, a new
explanation method superior to previous ones. By combining both contributions
in a fully unsupervised setup, we produce explanations of comparable quality,
or better, to that of a supervised approach. We release our code and model
weights.

    <title>Machine Learning Models Disclosure from Trusted Research Environments
  (TRE), Challenges and Opportunities</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare and medicine have
increased in recent years. To enable access to personal data, Trusted Research
environments (TREs) provide safe and secure environments in which researchers
can access sensitive personal data and develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning models. However currently few TREs support the use of
automated AI-based modelling using Machine Learning. Early attempts have been
made in the literature to present and introduce privacy preserving machine
learning from the design point of view [1]. However, there exists a gap in the
practical decision-making guidance for TREs in handling models disclosure.
Specifically, the use of machine learning creates a need to disclose new types
of outputs from TREs, such as trained machine learning models. Although TREs
have clear policies for the disclosure of statistical outputs, the extent to
which trained models can leak personal training data once released is not well
understood and guidelines do not exist within TREs for the safe disclosure of
these models.
  In this paper we introduce the challenge of disclosing trained machine
learning models from TREs. We first give an overview of machine learning models
in general and describe some of their applications in healthcare and medicine.
We define the main vulnerabilities of trained machine learning models in
general. We also describe the main factors affecting the vulnerabilities of
disclosing machine learning models. This paper also provides insights and
analyses methods that could be introduced within TREs to mitigate the risk of
privacy breaches when disclosing trained models.

    <title>Causal Inference via Nonlinear Variable Decorrelation for Healthcare
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Causal inference and model interpretability research are gaining increasing
attention, especially in the domains of healthcare and bioinformatics. Despite
recent successes in this field, decorrelating features under nonlinear
environments with human interpretable representations has not been adequately
investigated. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method with a
variable decorrelation regularizer to handle both linear and nonlinear
confounding. Moreover, we employ association rules as new representations using
association rule mining based on the original features to further proximate
human decision patterns to increase model interpretability. Extensive
experiments are conducted on four healthcare datasets (one synthetically
generated and three real-world collections on different diseases). Quantitative
results in comparison to baseline approaches on parameter estimation and
causality computation indicate the model's superior performance. Furthermore,
expert evaluation given by healthcare professionals validates the effectiveness
and interpretability of the proposed model.

    <title>Leveraging Generative AI Models for Synthetic Data Generation in
  Healthcare: Balancing Research and Privacy</title>
    <summary>  The widespread adoption of electronic health records and digital healthcare
data has created a demand for data-driven insights to enhance patient outcomes,
diagnostics, and treatments. However, using real patient data presents privacy
and regulatory challenges, including compliance with HIPAA and GDPR. Synthetic
data generation, using generative AI models like GANs and VAEs offers a
promising solution to balance valuable data access and patient privacy
protection. In this paper, we examine generative AI models for creating
realistic, anonymized patient data for research and training, explore synthetic
data applications in healthcare, and discuss its benefits, challenges, and
future research directions. Synthetic data has the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by providing anonymized patient data while preserving privacy and
enabling versatile applications.

    <title>Differentially Private Multi-Site Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Patient privacy is a major barrier to healthcare AI. For confidentiality
reasons, most patient data remains in silo in separate hospitals, preventing
the design of data-driven healthcare AI systems that need large volumes of
patient data to make effective decisions. A solution to this is collective
learning across multiple sites through federated learning with differential
privacy. However, literature in this space typically focuses on differentially
private statistical estimation and machine learning, which is different from
the causal inference-related problems that arise in healthcare. In this work,
we take a fresh look at federated learning with a focus on causal inference;
specifically, we look at estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), an
important task in causal inference for healthcare applications, and provide a
federated analytics approach to enable ATE estimation across multiple sites
along with differential privacy (DP) guarantees at each site. The main
challenge comes from site heterogeneity -- different sites have different
sample sizes and privacy budgets. We address this through a class of per-site
estimation algorithms that reports the ATE estimate and its variance as a
quality measure, and an aggregation algorithm on the server side that minimizes
the overall variance of the final ATE estimate. Our experiments on real and
synthetic data show that our method reliably aggregates private statistics
across sites and provides better privacy-utility tradeoff under site
heterogeneity than baselines.

    <title>Regret Bounds for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  In safety-critical applications of reinforcement learning such as healthcare
and robotics, it is often desirable to optimize risk-sensitive objectives that
account for tail outcomes rather than expected reward. We prove the first
regret bounds for reinforcement learning under a general class of
risk-sensitive objectives including the popular CVaR objective. Our theory is
based on a novel characterization of the CVaR objective as well as a novel
optimistic MDP construction.

    <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for Low-Resource Settings: A Vector Embedding
  Alignment Approach for Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale multi-modal deep learning models have revolutionized domains such
as healthcare, highlighting the importance of computational power. However, in
resource-constrained regions like Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs),
limited access to GPUs and data poses significant challenges, often leaving
CPUs as the sole resource. To address this, we advocate for leveraging vector
embeddings to enable flexible and efficient computational methodologies,
democratizing multimodal deep learning across diverse contexts.
  Our paper investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of using vector
embeddings from single-modal foundation models and multi-modal Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) for multimodal deep learning in low-resource environments,
particularly in healthcare. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective
inference-time method to enhance performance by aligning image-text embeddings.
Comparing these approaches with traditional methods, we assess their impact on
computational efficiency and model performance using metrics like accuracy,
F1-score, inference time, training time, and memory usage across three medical
modalities: BRSET (ophthalmology), HAM10000 (dermatology), and SatelliteBench
(public health).
  Our findings show that embeddings reduce computational demands without
compromising model performance. Furthermore, our alignment method improves
performance in medical tasks. This research promotes sustainable AI practices
by optimizing resources in constrained environments, highlighting the potential
of embedding-based approaches for efficient multimodal learning. Vector
embeddings democratize multimodal deep learning in LMICs, particularly in
healthcare, enhancing AI adaptability in varied use cases.

    <title>Adversarial Attacks to Machine Learning-Based Smart Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  The increasing availability of healthcare data requires accurate analysis of
disease diagnosis, progression, and realtime monitoring to provide improved
treatments to the patients. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) models are
used to extract valuable features and insights from high-dimensional and
heterogeneous healthcare data to detect different diseases and patient
activities in a Smart Healthcare System (SHS). However, recent researches show
that ML models used in different application domains are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial
attacks to exploit the ML classifiers used in a SHS. We consider an adversary
who has partial knowledge of data distribution, SHS model, and ML algorithm to
perform both targeted and untargeted attacks. Employing these adversarial
capabilities, we manipulate medical device readings to alter patient status
(disease-affected, normal condition, activities, etc.) in the outcome of the
SHS. Our attack utilizes five different adversarial ML algorithms (HopSkipJump,
Fast Gradient Method, Crafting Decision Tree, Carlini &amp; Wagner, Zeroth Order
Optimization) to perform different malicious activities (e.g., data poisoning,
misclassify outputs, etc.) on a SHS. Moreover, based on the training and
testing phase capabilities of an adversary, we perform white box and black box
attacks on a SHS. We evaluate the performance of our work in different SHS
settings and medical devices. Our extensive evaluation shows that our proposed
adversarial attack can significantly degrade the performance of a ML-based SHS
in detecting diseases and normal activities of the patients correctly, which
eventually leads to erroneous treatment.

    <title>A hybrid deep learning approach for medical relation extraction</title>
    <summary>  Mining relationships between treatment(s) and medical problem(s) is vital in
the biomedical domain. This helps in various applications, such as decision
support system, safety surveillance, and new treatment discovery. We propose a
deep learning approach that utilizes both word level and sentence-level
representations to extract the relationships between treatment and problem.
While deep learning techniques demand a large amount of data for training, we
make use of a rule-based system particularly for relationship classes with
fewer samples. Our final relations are derived by jointly combining the results
from deep learning and rule-based models. Our system achieved a promising
performance on the relationship classes of I2b2 2010 relation extraction task.

    <summary>  The electronic healthcare databases are starting to become more readily
available and are thought to have excellent potential for generating adverse
drug reaction signals. The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is an
electronic healthcare database containing medical information on over 11
million patients that has excellent potential for detecting ADRs. In this paper
we apply four existing electronic healthcare database signal detecting
algorithms (MUTARA, HUNT, Temporal Pattern Discovery and modified ROR) on the
THIN database for a selection of drugs from six chosen drug families. This is
the first comparison of ADR signalling algorithms that includes MUTARA and HUNT
and enabled us to set a benchmark for the adverse drug reaction signalling
ability of the THIN database. The drugs were selectively chosen to enable a
comparison with previous work and for variety. It was found that no algorithm
was generally superior and the algorithms' natural thresholds act at variable
stringencies. Furthermore, none of the algorithms perform well at detecting
rare ADRs.

    <title>Federated Learning: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) is a concept first introduced by Google in 2016, in
which multiple devices collaboratively learn a machine learning model without
sharing their private data under the supervision of a central server. This
offers ample opportunities in critical domains such as healthcare, finance etc,
where it is risky to share private user information to other organisations or
devices. While FL appears to be a promising Machine Learning (ML) technique to
keep the local data private, it is also vulnerable to attacks like other ML
models. Given the growing interest in the FL domain, this report discusses the
opportunities and challenges in federated learning.

    <title>HealthGuard: A Machine Learning-Based Security Framework for Smart
  Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  The integration of Internet-of-Things and pervasive computing in medical
devices have made the modern healthcare system "smart". Today, the function of
the healthcare system is not limited to treat the patients only. With the help
of implantable medical devices and wearables, Smart Healthcare System (SHS) can
continuously monitor different vital signs of a patient and automatically
detect and prevent critical medical conditions. However, these increasing
functionalities of SHS raise several security concerns and attackers can
exploit the SHS in numerous ways: they can impede normal function of the SHS,
inject false data to change vital signs, and tamper a medical device to change
the outcome of a medical emergency. In this paper, we propose HealthGuard, a
novel machine learning-based security framework to detect malicious activities
in a SHS. HealthGuard observes the vital signs of different connected devices
of a SHS and correlates the vitals to understand the changes in body functions
of the patient to distinguish benign and malicious activities. HealthGuard
utilizes four different machine learning-based detection techniques (Artificial
Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor) to detect
malicious activities in a SHS. We trained HealthGuard with data collected for
eight different smart medical devices for twelve benign events including seven
normal user activities and five disease-affected events. Furthermore, we
evaluated the performance of HealthGuard against three different malicious
threats. Our extensive evaluation shows that HealthGuard is an effective
security framework for SHS with an accuracy of 91% and an F-1 score of 90%.

    <title>Designing ECG Monitoring Healthcare System with Federated Transfer
  Learning and Explainable AI</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning play a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using
the electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models
normally requires a large amount of data and it can lead to privacy concerns.
Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected
from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with
no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical
healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health
systems. In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based
healthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as
data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework
setting effectively classifies arrhythmia's using an autoencoder and a
classifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally,
we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the
classification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and
reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98%
for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with
five-fold cross-validation.

    <title>Survey Bandits with Regret Guarantees</title>
    <summary>  We consider a variant of the contextual bandit problem. In standard
contextual bandits, when a user arrives we get the user's complete feature
vector and then assign a treatment (arm) to that user. In a number of
applications (like healthcare), collecting features from users can be costly.
To address this issue, we propose algorithms that avoid needless feature
collection while maintaining strong regret guarantees.

    <title>Representation Learning for Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Information in electronic health records (EHR), such as clinical narratives,
examination reports, lab measurements, demographics, and other patient
encounter entries, can be transformed into appropriate data representations
that can be used for downstream clinical machine learning tasks using
representation learning. Learning better representations is critical to improve
the performance of downstream tasks. Due to the advances in machine learning,
we now can learn better and meaningful representations from EHR through
disentangling the underlying factors inside data and distilling large amounts
of information and knowledge from heterogeneous EHR sources. In this chapter,
we first introduce the background of learning representations and reasons why
we need good EHR representations in machine learning for medicine and
healthcare in Section 1. Next, we explain the commonly-used machine learning
and evaluation methods for representation learning using a deep learning
approach in Section 2. Following that, we review recent related studies of
learning patient state representation from EHR for clinical machine learning
tasks in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss more techniques, studies,
and challenges for learning natural language representations when free texts,
such as clinical notes, examination reports, or biomedical literature are used.
We also discuss challenges and opportunities in these rapidly growing research
fields.

    <title>A comparative study of machine learning techniques used in non-clinical
  systems for continuous healthcare of independent livings</title>
    <summary>  New technologies are adapted to made progress in healthcare especially for
independent livings. Medication at distance is leading to integrate
technologies with medical. Machine learning methods in collaboration with
wearable sensor network technology are used to find hidden patterns in data,
detect patient movements, observe habits of patient, analyze clinical data of
patient, find intention of patients and make decision on the bases of gathered
data. This research performs comparative study on non-clinical systems in
healthcare for independent livings. In this study, these systems are
sub-divided w.r.t their working into two types: single purpose systems and
multi-purpose systems. Systems that are built for single specific purpose (e.g.
detect fall, detect emergent state of chronic disease patient) and cannot
support healthcare generically are known as single purpose systems, where
multi-purpose systems are built to serve for multiple problems (e.g. heart
attack etc.) by using single system. This study analyzes usages of machine
learning techniques in healthcare systems for independent livings. Answer Set
Programming (ASP), Artificial Neural Networks, Classification, Sampling and
Rule Based Reasoning etc. are some state of art techniques used to determine
emergent situations and observe changes in patient data. Among all methods, ASP
logic is used most widely, it is due to its feature to deal with incomplete
data. It is also observed that system using ANN shows better accuracy than
other systems. It is observed that most of the systems created are for single
purpose. In this work, 10 single purpose systems and 5 multi-purpose systems
are studied. There is need to create more generic systems that can be used for
patients with multiple diseases. Also most of the systems created are
prototypical. There is need to create systems that can serve healthcare
services in real world.

    <title>Synthesising Electronic Health Records: Cystic Fibrosis Patient Group</title>
    <summary>  Class imbalance can often degrade predictive performance of supervised
learning algorithms. Balanced classes can be obtained by oversampling exact
copies, with noise, or interpolation between nearest neighbours (as in
traditional SMOTE methods). Oversampling tabular data using augmentation, as is
typical in computer vision tasks, can be achieved with deep generative models.
Deep generative models are effective data synthesisers due to their ability to
capture complex underlying distributions. Synthetic data in healthcare can
enhance interoperability between healthcare providers by ensuring patient
privacy. Equipped with large synthetic datasets which do well to represent
small patient groups, machine learning in healthcare can address the current
challenges of bias and generalisability. This paper evaluates synthetic data
generators ability to synthesise patient electronic health records. We test the
utility of synthetic data for patient outcome classification, observing
increased predictive performance when augmenting imbalanced datasets with
synthetic data.

    <title>Effective Abnormal Activity Detection on Multivariate Time Series
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time series (MTS) data collected from multiple sensors provide
the potential for accurate abnormal activity detection in smart healthcare
scenarios. However, anomalies exhibit diverse patterns and become unnoticeable
in MTS data. Consequently, achieving accurate anomaly detection is challenging
since we have to capture both temporal dependencies of time series and
inter-relationships among variables. To address this problem, we propose a
Residual-based Anomaly Detection approach, Rs-AD, for effective representation
learning and abnormal activity detection. We evaluate our scheme on a
real-world gait dataset and the experimental results demonstrate an F1 score of
0.839.

    <title>Hardware Implementation of Deep Network Accelerators Towards Healthcare
  and Biomedical Applications</title>
    <summary>  The advent of dedicated Deep Learning (DL) accelerators and neuromorphic
processors has brought on new opportunities for applying both Deep and Spiking
Neural Network (SNN) algorithms to healthcare and biomedical applications at
the edge. This can facilitate the advancement of medical Internet of Things
(IoT) systems and Point of Care (PoC) devices. In this paper, we provide a
tutorial describing how various technologies including emerging memristive
devices, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor (CMOS) can be used to develop efficient DL accelerators to solve
a wide variety of diagnostic, pattern recognition, and signal processing
problems in healthcare. Furthermore, we explore how spiking neuromorphic
processors can complement their DL counterparts for processing biomedical
signals. The tutorial is augmented with case studies of the vast literature on
neural network and neuromorphic hardware as applied to the healthcare domain.
We benchmark various hardware platforms by performing a sensor fusion signal
processing task combining electromyography (EMG) signals with computer vision.
Comparisons are made between dedicated neuromorphic processors and embedded AI
accelerators in terms of inference latency and energy. Finally, we provide our
analysis of the field and share a perspective on the advantages, disadvantages,
challenges, and opportunities that various accelerators and neuromorphic
processors introduce to healthcare and biomedical domains.

    <title>Semi-Markov Offline Reinforcement Learning for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks are typically framed as Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs), assuming that decisions are made at fixed time intervals.
However, many applications of great importance, including healthcare, do not
satisfy this assumption, yet they are commonly modelled as MDPs after an
artificial reshaping of the data. In addition, most healthcare (and similar)
problems are offline by nature, allowing for only retrospective studies. To
address both challenges, we begin by discussing the Semi-MDP (SMDP) framework,
which formally handles actions of variable timings. We next present a formal
way to apply SMDP modifications to nearly any given value-based offline RL
method. We use this theory to introduce three SMDP-based offline RL algorithms,
namely, SDQN, SDDQN, and SBCQ. We then experimentally demonstrate that only
these SMDP-based algorithms learn the optimal policy in variable-time
environments, whereas their MDP counterparts do not. Finally, we apply our new
algorithms to a real-world offline dataset pertaining to warfarin dosing for
stroke prevention and demonstrate similar results.

    <title>Segmentation of Lungs COVID Infected Regions by Attention Mechanism and
  Synthetic Data</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Fatalities could
decrease if every patient could get suitable treatment by the healthcare
system. Machine learning, especially computer vision methods based on deep
learning, can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat COVID-19
infected cases more efficiently. Hence, infected patients can get better
service from the healthcare system and decrease the number of deaths caused by
the coronavirus. This research proposes a method for segmenting infected lung
regions in a CT image. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network with an
attention mechanism is used to detect infected areas with complex patterns.
Attention blocks improve the segmentation accuracy by focusing on informative
parts of the image. Furthermore, a generative adversarial network generates
synthetic images for data augmentation and expansion of small available
datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method
compared to some existing procedures.

    <title>YouTube for Patient Education: A Deep Learning Approach for
  Understanding Medical Knowledge from User-Generated Videos</title>
    <summary>  YouTube presents an unprecedented opportunity to explore how machine learning
methods can improve healthcare information dissemination. We propose an
interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes machine learning methods with
healthcare informatics themes to address the critical issue of developing a
scalable algorithmic solution to evaluate videos from a health literacy and
patient education perspective. We develop a deep learning method to understand
the level of medical knowledge encoded in YouTube videos. Preliminary results
suggest that we can extract medical knowledge from YouTube videos and classify
videos according to the embedded knowledge with satisfying performance. Deep
learning methods show great promise in knowledge extraction, natural language
understanding, and image classification, especially in an era of
patient-centric care and precision medicine.

    <title>HiCu: Leveraging Hierarchy for Curriculum Learning in Automated ICD
  Coding</title>
    <summary>  There are several opportunities for automation in healthcare that can improve
clinician throughput. One such example is assistive tools to document diagnosis
codes when clinicians write notes. We study the automation of medical code
prediction using curriculum learning, which is a training strategy for machine
learning models that gradually increases the hardness of the learning tasks
from easy to difficult. One of the challenges in curriculum learning is the
design of curricula -- i.e., in the sequential design of tasks that gradually
increase in difficulty. We propose Hierarchical Curriculum Learning (HiCu), an
algorithm that uses graph structure in the space of outputs to design curricula
for multi-label classification. We create curricula for multi-label
classification models that predict ICD diagnosis and procedure codes from
natural language descriptions of patients. By leveraging the hierarchy of ICD
codes, which groups diagnosis codes based on various organ systems in the human
body, we find that our proposed curricula improve the generalization of neural
network-based predictive models across recurrent, convolutional, and
transformer-based architectures. Our code is available at
https://github.com/wren93/HiCu-ICD.

    <title>Trustworthy Privacy-preserving Hierarchical Ensemble and Federated
  Learning in Healthcare 4.0 with Blockchain</title>
    <summary>  The advancement of Internet and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has led to
the era of Industry 4.0. This shift is followed by healthcare industries
creating the term Healthcare 4.0. In Healthcare 4.0, the use of IoT-enabled
medical imaging devices for early disease detection has enabled medical
practitioners to increase healthcare institutions' quality of service. However,
Healthcare 4.0 is still lagging in Artificial Intelligence and big data
compared to other Industry 4.0 due to data privacy concerns. In addition,
institutions' diverse storage and computing capabilities restrict institutions
from incorporating the same training model structure. This paper presents a
secure multi-party computation-based ensemble federated learning with
blockchain that enables heterogeneous models to collaboratively learn from
healthcare institutions' data without violating users' privacy. Blockchain
properties also allow the party to enjoy data integrity without trust in a
centralized server while also providing each healthcare institution with
auditability and version control capability.

    <title>UniHPF : Universal Healthcare Predictive Framework with Zero Domain
  Knowledge</title>
    <summary>  Despite the abundance of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR), its
heterogeneity restricts the utilization of medical data in building predictive
models. To address this challenge, we propose Universal Healthcare Predictive
Framework (UniHPF), which requires no medical domain knowledge and minimal
pre-processing for multiple prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that UniHPF is capable of building large-scale EHR models that can process any
form of medical data from distinct EHR systems. We believe that our findings
can provide helpful insights for further research on the multi-source learning
of EHRs.

    <title>Collaborative Machine Learning-Driven Internet of Medical Things -- A
  Systematic Literature Review</title>
    <summary>  The growing adoption of IoT devices for healthcare has enabled researchers to
build intelligence using all the data produced by these devices. Monitoring and
diagnosing health have been the two most common scenarios where such devices
have proven beneficial. Achieving high prediction accuracy was a top priority
initially, but the focus has slowly shifted to efficiency and higher
throughput, and processing the data from these devices in a distributed manner
has proven to help achieve both. Since the field of machine learning is vast
with numerous state-of-the-art algorithms in play, it has been a challenge to
identify the algorithms that perform best in different scenarios. In this
literature review, we explored the distributed machine learning algorithms
tested by the authors of the selected studies and identified the ones that
achieved the best prediction accuracy in each healthcare scenario. While no
algorithm performed consistently, Random Forest performed the best in a few
studies. This could serve as a good starting point for future studies on
collaborative machine learning on IoMT data.

    <title>Deep Neural Network Based Ensemble learning Algorithms for the
  healthcare system (diagnosis of chronic diseases)</title>
    <summary>  learning algorithms. In this paper, we review the classification algorithms
used in the health care system (chronic diseases) and present the neural
network-based Ensemble learning method. We briefly describe the commonly used
algorithms and describe their critical properties. Materials and Methods: In
this study, modern classification algorithms used in healthcare, examine the
principles of these methods and guidelines, and to accurately diagnose and
predict chronic diseases, superior machine learning algorithms with the neural
network-based ensemble learning Is used. To do this, we use experimental data,
real data on chronic patients (diabetes, heart, cancer) available on the UCI
site. Results: We found that group algorithms designed to diagnose chronic
diseases can be more effective than baseline algorithms. It also identifies
several challenges to further advancing the classification of machine learning
in the diagnosis of chronic diseases. Conclusion: The results show the high
performance of the neural network-based Ensemble learning approach for the
diagnosis and prediction of chronic diseases, which in this study reached 98.5,
99, and 100% accuracy, respectively.

    <title>Multi-disciplinary fairness considerations in machine learning for
  clinical trials</title>
    <summary>  While interest in the application of machine learning to improve healthcare
has grown tremendously in recent years, a number of barriers prevent deployment
in medical practice. A notable concern is the potential to exacerbate
entrenched biases and existing health disparities in society. The area of
fairness in machine learning seeks to address these issues of equity; however,
appropriate approaches are context-dependent, necessitating domain-specific
consideration. We focus on clinical trials, i.e., research studies conducted on
humans to evaluate medical treatments. Clinical trials are a relatively
under-explored application in machine learning for healthcare, in part due to
complex ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements and high costs. Our aim is
to provide a multi-disciplinary assessment of how fairness for machine learning
fits into the context of clinical trials research and practice. We start by
reviewing the current ethical considerations and guidelines for clinical trials
and examine their relationship with common definitions of fairness in machine
learning. We examine potential sources of unfairness in clinical trials,
providing concrete examples, and discuss the role machine learning might play
in either mitigating potential biases or exacerbating them when applied without
care. Particular focus is given to adaptive clinical trials, which may employ
machine learning. Finally, we highlight concepts that require further
investigation and development, and emphasize new approaches to fairness that
may be relevant to the design of clinical trials.

    <title>Counterfactual Explanations and Predictive Models to Enhance Clinical
  Decision-Making in Schizophrenia using Digital Phenotyping</title>
    <summary>  Clinical practice in psychiatry is burdened with the increased demand for
healthcare services and the scarce resources available. New paradigms of health
data powered with machine learning techniques could open the possibility to
improve clinical workflow in critical stages of clinical assessment and
treatment in psychiatry. In this work, we propose a machine learning system
capable of predicting, detecting, and explaining individual changes in symptoms
of patients with Schizophrenia by using behavioral digital phenotyping data. We
forecast symptoms of patients with an error rate below 10%. The system detects
decreases in symptoms using changepoint algorithms and uses counterfactual
explanations as a recourse in a simulated continuous monitoring scenario in
healthcare. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the performance
and potential of counterfactual explanations, predictive models, and
change-point detection within a simulated clinical workflow. These findings lay
the foundation for further research to explore additional facets of the
workflow, aiming to enhance its effectiveness and applicability in real-world
healthcare settings. By leveraging these components, the goal is to develop an
actionable, interpretable, and trustworthy integrative decision support system
that combines real-time clinical assessments with sensor-based inputs.

    <title>MLHOps: Machine Learning for Healthcare Operations</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning Health Operations (MLHOps) is the combination of processes
for reliable, efficient, usable, and ethical deployment and maintenance of
machine learning models in healthcare settings. This paper provides both a
survey of work in this area and guidelines for developers and clinicians to
deploy and maintain their own models in clinical practice. We cover the
foundational concepts of general machine learning operations, describe the
initial setup of MLHOps pipelines (including data sources, preparation,
engineering, and tools). We then describe long-term monitoring and updating
(including data distribution shifts and model updating) and ethical
considerations (including bias, fairness, interpretability, and privacy). This
work therefore provides guidance across the full pipeline of MLHOps from
conception to initial and ongoing deployment.

    <title>Disease-Atlas: Navigating Disease Trajectories with Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data are commonly used in
longitudinal studies to forecast disease trajectories over time. While there
are many advantages to joint modeling, the standard forms suffer from
limitations that arise from a fixed model specification, and computational
difficulties when applied to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning approach to address these limitations, enhancing
existing methods with the inherent flexibility and scalability of deep neural
networks, while retaining the benefits of joint modeling. Using longitudinal
data from a real-world medical dataset, we demonstrate improvements in
performance and scalability, as well as robustness in the presence of
irregularly sampled data.

    <title>AutoPrognosis 2.0: Democratizing Diagnostic and Prognostic Modeling in
  Healthcare with Automated Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and
inform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have
shown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing
complex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.
However, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and
practical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such
techniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower
healthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,
AutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis
leverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop
optimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,
and enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant
technical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to
predictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical
adoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative
application where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the
UK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by
our automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert
clinical risk scores. Our risk score has been implemented as a web-based
decision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians
worldwide. In addition, AutoPrognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python
package. By open-sourcing our framework as a tool for the community, clinicians
and other medical practitioners will be able to readily develop new risk
scores, personalized diagnostics, and prognostics using modern machine learning
techniques.

    <title>IoT-Enabled Low-Cost Fog Computing System with Online Machine Learning
  for Accurate and Low-Latency Heart Monitoring in Rural Healthcare Settings</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare services in rural areas face numerous challenges due to the high
cost of treatment and a lack of appropriate services. The application of
Internet of Things (IoT) technology has shown potential in mitigating these
issues. This article discusses the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) and
fog computing to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. The use
of these technologies in cardiovascular health informatics is explored, along
with the economic thought process of hospital decision-makers and end-of-life
practices in intensive care units. Remote monitoring using IoT devices is
highlighted as a promising way to detect health issues before they become
serious, leading to earlier interventions and improved health outcomes. The use
of fog computing in healthcare is also discussed, with a focus on its ability
to provide real-time data processing, analysis, and decision-making
capabilities. The article presents a novel architecture for
Device-as-a-Service, utilizing both fog and cloud computing to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of ECG device processing, and concludes that it has the
potential to reduce costs by up to 80% in the Iranian market. The adoption of
fog computing in healthcare is acknowledged to present significant challenges,
such as security and privacy concerns,

    <title>Towards Wide Learning: Experiments in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, a Wide Learning architecture is proposed that attempts to
automate the feature engineering portion of the machine learning (ML) pipeline.
Feature engineering is widely considered as the most time consuming and expert
knowledge demanding portion of any ML task. The proposed feature recommendation
approach is tested on 3 healthcare datasets: a) PhysioNet Challenge 2016
dataset of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, b) MIMIC II blood pressure
classification dataset of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and c) an emotion
classification dataset of PPG signals. While the proposed method beats the
state of the art techniques for 2nd and 3rd dataset, it reaches 94.38% of the
accuracy level of the winner of PhysioNet Challenge 2016. In all cases, the
effort to reach a satisfactory performance was drastically less (a few days)
than manual feature engineering.

    <title>Mixture of Coupled HMMs for Robust Modeling of Multivariate Healthcare
  Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Analysis of multivariate healthcare time series data is inherently
challenging: irregular sampling, noisy and missing values, and heterogeneous
patient groups with different dynamics violating exchangeability. In addition,
interpretability and quantification of uncertainty are critically important.
Here, we propose a novel class of models, a mixture of coupled hidden Markov
models (M-CHMM), and demonstrate how it elegantly overcomes these challenges.
To make the model learning feasible, we derive two algorithms to sample the
sequences of the latent variables in the CHMM: samplers based on (i) particle
filtering and (ii) factorized approximation. Compared to existing inference
methods, our algorithms are computationally tractable, improve mixing, and
allow for likelihood estimation, which is necessary to learn the mixture model.
Experiments on challenging real-world epidemiological and semi-synthetic data
demonstrate the advantages of the M-CHMM: improved data fit, capacity to
efficiently handle missing and noisy measurements, improved prediction
accuracy, and ability to identify interpretable subsets in the data.

    <title>Predicting Consultation Success in Online Health Platforms Using Dynamic
  Knowledge Networks and Multimodal Data Fusion</title>
    <summary>  Online healthcare consultation in virtual health is an emerging industry
marked by innovation and fierce competition. Accurate and timely prediction of
healthcare consultation success can proactively help online platforms address
patient concerns and improve retention rates. However, predicting online
consultation success is challenging due to the partial role of virtual
consultations in patients' overall healthcare journey and the disconnect
between online and in-person healthcare IT systems. Patient data in online
consultations is often sparse and incomplete, presenting significant technical
challenges and a research gap. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic
Knowledge Network and Multimodal Data Fusion (DyKoNeM) framework, which
enhances the predictive power of online healthcare consultations. Our work has
important implications for new business models where specific and detailed
online communication processes are stored in the IT database, and at the same
time, latent information with predictive power is embedded in the network
formed by stakeholders' digital traces. It can be extended to diverse
industries and domains, where the virtual or hybrid model (e.g., integration of
online and offline services) is emerging as a prevailing trend.

    <title>Sample Size in Natural Language Processing within Healthcare Research</title>
    <summary>  Sample size calculation is an essential step in most data-based disciplines.
Large enough samples ensure representativeness of the population and determine
the precision of estimates. This is true for most quantitative studies,
including those that employ machine learning methods, such as natural language
processing, where free-text is used to generate predictions and classify
instances of text. Within the healthcare domain, the lack of sufficient corpora
of previously collected data can be a limiting factor when determining sample
sizes for new studies. This paper tries to address the issue by making
recommendations on sample sizes for text classification tasks in the healthcare
domain.
  Models trained on the MIMIC-III database of critical care records from Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center were used to classify documents as having or
not having Unspecified Essential Hypertension, the most common diagnosis code
in the database. Simulations were performed using various classifiers on
different sample sizes and class proportions. This was repeated for a
comparatively less common diagnosis code within the database of diabetes
mellitus without mention of complication.
  Smaller sample sizes resulted in better results when using a K-nearest
neighbours classifier, whereas larger sample sizes provided better results with
support vector machines and BERT models. Overall, a sample size larger than
1000 was sufficient to provide decent performance metrics.
  The simulations conducted within this study provide guidelines that can be
used as recommendations for selecting appropriate sample sizes and class
proportions, and for predicting expected performance, when building classifiers
for textual healthcare data. The methodology used here can be modified for
sample size estimates calculations with other datasets.

    <title>Cloud-based Federated Learning Framework for MRI Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  In contemporary rural healthcare settings, the principal challenge in
diagnosing brain images is the scarcity of available data, given that most of
the existing deep learning models demand extensive training data to optimize
their performance, necessitating centralized processing methods that
potentially compromise data privacy. This paper proposes a novel framework
tailored for brain tissue segmentation in rural healthcare facilities. The
framework employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment in tandem
with a refinement model (RM) deployed locally at rural healthcare sites. The
proposed DRL model has a reduced parameter count and practicality for
implementation across distributed rural sites. To uphold data privacy and
enhance model generalization without transgressing privacy constraints, we
employ federated learning (FL) for cooperative model training. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach by training the network with a limited data set
and observing a substantial performance enhancement, mitigating inaccuracies
and irregularities in segmentation across diverse sites. Remarkably, the DRL
model attains an accuracy of up to 80%, surpassing the capabilities of
conventional convolutional neural networks when confronted with data
insufficiency. Incorporating our RM results in an additional accuracy
improvement of at least 10%, while FL contributes to a further accuracy
enhancement of up to 5%. Collectively, the framework achieves an average 92%
accuracy rate within rural healthcare settings characterized by data
constraints.

    <title>When Machine Learning Meets Privacy: A Survey and Outlook</title>
    <summary>  The newly emerged machine learning (e.g. deep learning) methods have become a
strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart
healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy
has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial
intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy
preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in
traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend
and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine
learning (ML) is still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only
focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a
comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning
is required. This paper surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and
solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of
interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine
learning, (ii) machine learning aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine
learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current
research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are
identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and
machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.

    <title>Explainable AI for Mental Disorder Detection via Social Media: A survey
  and outlook</title>
    <summary>  Mental health constitutes a complex and pervasive global challenge, affecting
millions of lives and often leading to severe consequences. In this paper, we
conduct a thorough survey to explore the intersection of data science,
artificial intelligence, and mental healthcare, focusing on the recent
developments of mental disorder detection through online social media (OSM). A
significant portion of the population actively engages in OSM platforms,
creating a vast repository of personal data that holds immense potential for
mental health analytics. The paper navigates through traditional diagnostic
methods, state-of-the-art data- and AI-driven research studies, and the
emergence of explainable AI (XAI) models for mental healthcare. We review
state-of-the-art machine learning methods, particularly those based on modern
deep learning, while emphasising the need for explainability in healthcare AI
models. The experimental design section provides insights into prevalent
practices, including available datasets and evaluation approaches. We also
identify key issues and challenges in the field and propose promising future
research directions. As mental health decisions demand transparency,
interpretability, and ethical considerations, this paper contributes to the
ongoing discourse on advancing XAI in mental healthcare through social media.
The comprehensive overview presented here aims to guide researchers,
practitioners, and policymakers in developing the area of mental disorder
detection.

    <title>Target specification bias, counterfactual prediction, and algorithmic
  fairness in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Bias in applications of machine learning (ML) to healthcare is usually
attributed to unrepresentative or incomplete data, or to underlying health
disparities. This article identifies a more pervasive source of bias that
affects the clinical utility of ML-enabled prediction tools: target
specification bias. Target specification bias arises when the
operationalization of the target variable does not match its definition by
decision makers. The mismatch is often subtle, and stems from the fact that
decision makers are typically interested in predicting the outcomes of
counterfactual, rather than actual, healthcare scenarios. Target specification
bias persists independently of data limitations and health disparities. When
left uncorrected, it gives rise to an overestimation of predictive accuracy, to
inefficient utilization of medical resources, and to suboptimal decisions that
can harm patients. Recent work in metrology - the science of measurement -
suggests ways of counteracting target specification bias and avoiding its
harmful consequences.

    <title>Distilling Knowledge from Deep Networks with Applications to Healthcare
  Domain</title>
    <summary>  Exponential growth in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has resulted in new
opportunities and urgent needs for discovery of meaningful data-driven
representations and patterns of diseases in Computational Phenotyping research.
Deep Learning models have shown superior performance for robust prediction in
computational phenotyping tasks, but suffer from the issue of model
interpretability which is crucial for clinicians involved in decision-making.
In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge-distillation approach called
Interpretable Mimic Learning, to learn interpretable phenotype features for
making robust prediction while mimicking the performance of deep learning
models. Our framework uses Gradient Boosting Trees to learn interpretable
features from deep learning models such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and
Long Short-Term Memory. Exhaustive experiments on a real-world clinical
time-series dataset show that our method obtains similar or better performance
than the deep learning models, and it provides interpretable phenotypes for
clinical decision making.

    <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-task Learning and Multi-task
  Pre-training on EHR Time-series Data</title>
    <summary>  Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning technique aiming to improve
model performance by leveraging information across many tasks. It has been used
extensively on various data modalities, including electronic health record
(EHR) data. However, despite significant use on EHR data, there has been little
systematic investigation of the utility of MTL across the diverse set of
possible tasks and training schemes of interest in healthcare. In this work, we
examine MTL across a battery of tasks on EHR time-series data. We find that
while MTL does suffer from common negative transfer, we can realize significant
gains via MTL pre-training combined with single-task fine-tuning. We
demonstrate that these gains can be achieved in a task-independent manner and
offer not only minor improvements under traditional learning, but also notable
gains in a few-shot learning context, thereby suggesting this could be a
scalable vehicle to offer improved performance in important healthcare
contexts.

    <title>A New Interpretable Neural Network-Based Rule Model for Healthcare
  Decision Making</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare applications, understanding how machine/deep learning models
make decisions is crucial. In this study, we introduce a neural network
framework, $\textit{Truth Table rules}$ (TT-rules), that combines the global
and exact interpretability properties of rule-based models with the high
performance of deep neural networks. TT-rules is built upon $\textit{Truth
Table nets}$ (TTnet), a family of deep neural networks initially developed for
formal verification. By extracting the necessary and sufficient rules
$\mathcal{R}$ from the trained TTnet model (global interpretability) to yield
the same output as the TTnet (exact interpretability), TT-rules effectively
transforms the neural network into a rule-based model. This rule-based model
supports binary classification, multi-label classification, and regression
tasks for small to large tabular datasets. After outlining the framework, we
evaluate TT-rules' performance on healthcare applications and compare it to
state-of-the-art rule-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TT-rules
achieves equal or higher performance compared to other interpretable methods.
Notably, TT-rules presents the first accurate rule-based model capable of
fitting large tabular datasets, including two real-life DNA datasets with over
20K features.

    <title>An ExplainableFair Framework for Prediction of Substance Use Disorder
  Treatment Completion</title>
    <summary>  Fairness of machine learning models in healthcare has drawn increasing
attention from clinicians, researchers, and even at the highest level of
government. On the other hand, the importance of developing and deploying
interpretable or explainable models has been demonstrated, and is essential to
increasing the trustworthiness and likelihood of adoption of these models. The
objective of this study was to develop and implement a framework for addressing
both these issues - fairness and explainability. We propose an explainable
fairness framework, first developing a model with optimized performance, and
then using an in-processing approach to mitigate model biases relative to the
sensitive attributes of race and sex. We then explore and visualize
explanations of the model changes that lead to the fairness enhancement process
through exploring the changes in importance of features. Our resulting-fairness
enhanced models retain high sensitivity with improved fairness and explanations
of the fairness-enhancement that may provide helpful insights for healthcare
providers to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation.

    <title>Missing Values and Imputation in Healthcare Data: Can Interpretable
  Machine Learning Help?</title>
    <summary>  Missing values are a fundamental problem in data science. Many datasets have
missing values that must be properly handled because the way missing values are
treated can have large impact on the resulting machine learning model. In
medical applications, the consequences may affect healthcare decisions. There
are many methods in the literature for dealing with missing values, including
state-of-the-art methods which often depend on black-box models for imputation.
In this work, we show how recent advances in interpretable machine learning
provide a new perspective for understanding and tackling the missing value
problem. We propose methods based on high-accuracy glass-box Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) that can help users (1) gain new insights on
missingness mechanisms and better understand the causes of missingness, and (2)
detect -- or even alleviate -- potential risks introduced by imputation
algorithms. Experiments on real-world medical datasets illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

    <title>An Overview of Human Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors:
  Healthcare and Artificial Intelligence</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, human activity recognition (HAR) has been
applied in a variety of domains such as security and surveillance, human-robot
interaction, and entertainment. Even though a number of surveys and review
papers have been published, there is a lack of HAR overview papers focusing on
healthcare applications that use wearable sensors. Therefore, we fill in the
gap by presenting this overview paper. In particular, we present our projects
to illustrate the system design of HAR applications for healthcare. Our
projects include early mobility identification of human activities for
intensive care unit (ICU) patients and gait analysis of Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD) patients. We cover essential components of designing HAR
systems including sensor factors (e.g., type, number, and placement location),
AI model selection (e.g., classical machine learning models versus deep
learning models), and feature engineering. In addition, we highlight the
challenges of such healthcare-oriented HAR systems and propose several research
opportunities for both the medical and the computer science community.

    <title>Multi-Task Learning with Incomplete Data for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Multi-task learning is a type of transfer learning that trains multiple tasks
simultaneously and leverages the shared information between related tasks to
improve the generalization performance. However, missing features in the input
matrix is a much more difficult problem which needs to be carefully addressed.
Removing records with missing values can significantly reduce the sample size,
which is impractical for datasets with large percentage of missing values.
Popular imputation methods often distort the covariance structure of the data,
which causes inaccurate inference. In this paper we propose using plug-in
covariance matrix estimators to tackle the challenge of missing features.
Specifically, we analyze the plug-in estimators under the framework of robust
multi-task learning with LASSO and graph regularization, which captures the
relatedness between tasks via graph regularization. We use the Alzheimer's
disease progression dataset as an example to show how the proposed framework is
effective for prediction and model estimation when missing data is present.

    <title>MD-MTL: An Ensemble Med-Multi-Task Learning Package for DiseaseScores
  Prediction and Multi-Level Risk Factor Analysis</title>
    <summary>  While many machine learning methods have been used for medical prediction and
risk factor analysis on healthcare data, most prior research has involved
single-task learning (STL) methods. However, healthcare research often involves
multiple related tasks. For instance, implementation of disease scores
prediction and risk factor analysis in multiple subgroups of patients
simultaneously and risk factor analysis at multi-levels synchronously. In this
paper, we developed a new ensemble machine learning Python package based on
multi-task learning (MTL), referred to as the Med-Multi-Task Learning (MD-MTL)
package and applied it in predicting disease scores of patients, and in
carrying out risk factor analysis on multiple subgroups of patients
simultaneously. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the
utility of the MD-MTL package, and show the advantage of MTL (vs. STL), when
analyzing data that is organized into different categories (tasks, which can be
various age groups, different levels of disease severity, etc.).

    <title>Sequential Interpretability: Methods, Applications, and Future Direction
  for Understanding Deep Learning Models in the Context of Sequential Data</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning continues to revolutionize an ever-growing number of critical
application areas including healthcare, transportation, finance, and basic
sciences. Despite their increased predictive power, model transparency and
human explainability remain a significant challenge due to the "black box"
nature of modern deep learning models. In many cases the desired balance
between interpretability and performance is predominately task specific.
Human-centric domains such as healthcare necessitate a renewed focus on
understanding how and why these frameworks are arriving at critical and
potentially life-or-death decisions. Given the quantity of research and
empirical successes of deep learning for computer vision, most of the existing
interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques.
Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning
frameworks using sequential data. Given recent deep learning advancements in
highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological
signal processing, the need for deep sequential explanations is at an all-time
high. In this paper, we review current techniques for interpreting deep
learning techniques involving sequential data, identify similarities to
non-sequential methods, and discuss current limitations and future avenues of
sequential interpretability research.

    <title>Organizational Governance of Emerging Technologies: AI Adoption in
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Private and public sector structures and norms refine how emerging technology
is used in practice. In healthcare, despite a proliferation of AI adoption, the
organizational governance surrounding its use and integration is often poorly
understood. What the Health AI Partnership (HAIP) aims to do in this research
is to better define the requirements for adequate organizational governance of
AI systems in healthcare settings and support health system leaders to make
more informed decisions around AI adoption. To work towards this understanding,
we first identify how the standards for the AI adoption in healthcare may be
designed to be used easily and efficiently. Then, we map out the precise
decision points involved in the practical institutional adoption of AI
technology within specific health systems. Practically, we achieve this through
a multi-organizational collaboration with leaders from major health systems
across the United States and key informants from related fields. Working with
the consultancy IDEO [dot] org, we were able to conduct usability-testing
sessions with healthcare and AI ethics professionals. Usability analysis
revealed a prototype structured around mock key decision points that align with
how organizational leaders approach technology adoption. Concurrently, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 89 professionals in healthcare and
other relevant fields. Using a modified grounded theory approach, we were able
to identify 8 key decision points and comprehensive procedures throughout the
AI adoption lifecycle. This is one of the most detailed qualitative analyses to
date of the current governance structures and processes involved in AI adoption
by health systems in the United States. We hope these findings can inform
future efforts to build capabilities to promote the safe, effective, and
responsible adoption of emerging technologies in healthcare.

    <title>Causal Inference in medicine and in health policy, a summary</title>
    <summary>  A data science task can be deemed as making sense of the data or testing a
hypothesis about it. The conclusions inferred from data can greatly guide us to
make informative decisions. Big data has enabled us to carry out countless
prediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high
risk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures.
However, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they
are also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and
clinical outcomes. Understanding such relations will help doctors treat
patients and reduce the risk effectively. Causality is typically identified by
randomized controlled trials. Often such trials are not feasible when
scientists and researchers turn to observational studies and attempt to draw
inferences. However, observational studies may also be affected by selection
and/or confounding biases that can result in wrong causal conclusions. In this
chapter, we will try to highlight some of the drawbacks that may arise in
traditional machine learning and statistical approaches to analyze the
observational data, particularly in the healthcare data analytics domain. We
will discuss causal inference and ways to discover the cause-effect from
observational studies in healthcare domain. Moreover, we will demonstrate the
applications of causal inference in tackling some common machine learning
issues such as missing data and model transportability. Finally, we will
discuss the possibility of integrating reinforcement learning with causality as
a way to counter confounding bias.

    <title>Distributed representation of patients and its use for medical cost
  prediction</title>
    <summary>  Efficient representation of patients is very important in the healthcare
domain and can help with many tasks such as medical risk prediction. Many
existing methods, such as diagnostic Cost Groups (DCG), rely on expert
knowledge to build patient representation from medical data, which is resource
consuming and non-scalable. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are a good
choice for automating the representation learning process. However, there is
very little research focusing on onpatient-level representation learning
directly from medical claims. In this paper, weproposed a novel patient vector
learning architecture that learns high quality,fixed-length patient
representation from claims data. We conducted several experiments to test the
quality of our learned representation, and the empirical results show that our
learned patient vectors are superior to vectors learned through other methods
including a popular commercial model. Lastly, we provide potential clinical
interpretation for using our representation on predictive tasks, as
interpretability is vital in the healthcare domain

    <title>Ensuring Ground Truth Accuracy in Healthcare with the EVINCE framework</title>
    <summary>  Misdiagnosis is a significant issue in healthcare, leading to harmful
consequences for patients. The propagation of mislabeled data through machine
learning models into clinical practice is unacceptable. This paper proposes
EVINCE, a system designed to 1) improve diagnosis accuracy and 2) rectify
misdiagnoses and minimize training data errors. EVINCE stands for Entropy
Variation through Information Duality with Equal Competence, leveraging this
novel theory to optimize the diagnostic process using multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a structured debate framework. Our empirical study verifies
EVINCE to be effective in achieving its design goals.

    <title>Federated Learning and Blockchain-enabled Fog-IoT Platform for Wearables
  in Predictive Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT)
devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that
benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can
improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of
wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and
network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a
platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a
fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing
data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network's distributive
structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a
testbed to examine the proposed platform's ability to preserve the integrity of
a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation
can effectively preserve a patient's privacy and a predictive service's
integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to
the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the
feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy
challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis,
simulation, and experimentation.

    <title>Distributed Conditional GAN (discGAN) For Synthetic Healthcare Data
  Generation</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a distributed Generative Adversarial Networks
(discGANs) to generate synthetic tabular data specific to the healthcare
domain. While using GANs to generate images has been well studied, little to no
attention has been given to generation of tabular data. Modeling distributions
of discrete and continuous tabular data is a non-trivial task with high
utility. We applied discGAN to model non-Gaussian multi-modal healthcare data.
We generated 249,000 synthetic records from original 2,027 eICU dataset. We
evaluated the performance of the model using machine learning efficacy, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for continuous variables and chi-squared test for
discrete variables. Our results show that discGAN was able to generate data
with distributions similar to the real data.

    <title>A Framework for Assurance of Medication Safety using Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Medication errors continue to be the leading cause of avoidable patient harm
in hospitals. This paper sets out a framework to assure medication safety that
combines machine learning and safety engineering methods. It uses safety
analysis to proactively identify potential causes of medication error, based on
expert opinion. As healthcare is now data rich, it is possible to augment
safety analysis with machine learning to discover actual causes of medication
error from the data, and to identify where they deviate from what was predicted
in the safety analysis. Combining these two views has the potential to enable
the risk of medication errors to be managed proactively and dynamically. We
apply the framework to a case study involving thoracic surgery, e.g.
oesophagectomy, where errors in giving beta-blockers can be critical to control
atrial fibrillation. This case study combines a HAZOP-based safety analysis
method known as SHARD with Bayesian network structure learning and process
mining to produce the analysis results, showing the potential of the framework
for ensuring patient safety, and for transforming the way that safety is
managed in complex healthcare environments.

    <title>MIMIC-IF: Interpretability and Fairness Evaluation of Deep Learning
  Models on MIMIC-IV Dataset</title>
    <summary>  The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled
the research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications.
However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about
interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human
lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examinations of both
datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare
dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of dataset representation bias as
well as interpretability and prediction fairness of deep learning models for
in-hospital mortality prediction. In terms of interpretabilty, we observe that
(1) the best performing interpretability method successfully identifies
critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models; (2)
demographic features are important for prediction. In terms of fairness, we
observe that (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical
ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) all of
the studied mortality predictors are generally fair while the IMV-LSTM
(Interpretable Multi-Variable Long Short-Term Memory) model provides the most
accurate and unbiased predictions across all protected groups. We further draw
concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by
showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial
in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors.

    <title>Dynamic Healthcare Embeddings for Improving Patient Care</title>
    <summary>  As hospitals move towards automating and integrating their computing systems,
more fine-grained hospital operations data are becoming available. These data
include hospital architectural drawings, logs of interactions between patients
and healthcare professionals, prescription data, procedures data, and data on
patient admission, discharge, and transfers. This has opened up many
fascinating avenues for healthcare-related prediction tasks for improving
patient care. However, in order to leverage off-the-shelf machine learning
software for these tasks, one needs to learn structured representations of
entities involved from heterogeneous, dynamic data streams. Here, we propose
DECENT, an auto-encoding heterogeneous co-evolving dynamic neural network, for
learning heterogeneous dynamic embeddings of patients, doctors, rooms, and
medications from diverse data streams. These embeddings capture similarities
among doctors, rooms, patients, and medications based on static attributes and
dynamic interactions. DECENT enables several applications in healthcare
prediction, such as predicting mortality risk and case severity of patients,
adverse events (e.g., transfer back into an intensive care unit), and future
healthcare-associated infections. The results of using the learned patient
embeddings in predictive modeling show that DECENT has a gain of up to 48.1% on
the mortality risk prediction task, 12.6% on the case severity prediction task,
6.4% on the medical intensive care unit transfer task, and 3.8% on the
Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) Infection (CDI) prediction task over the
state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, case studies on the learned doctor,
medication, and room embeddings show that our approach learns meaningful and
interpretable embeddings.

    <title>M$^3$Fair: Mitigating Bias in Healthcare Data through Multi-Level and
  Multi-Sensitive-Attribute Reweighting Method</title>
    <summary>  In the data-driven artificial intelligence paradigm, models heavily rely on
large amounts of training data. However, factors like sampling distribution
imbalance can lead to issues of bias and unfairness in healthcare data.
Sensitive attributes, such as race, gender, age, and medical condition, are
characteristics of individuals that are commonly associated with discrimination
or bias. In healthcare AI, these attributes can play a significant role in
determining the quality of care that individuals receive. For example, minority
groups often receive fewer procedures and poorer-quality medical care than
white individuals in US. Therefore, detecting and mitigating bias in data is
crucial to enhancing health equity. Bias mitigation methods include
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Among them, Reweighting
(RW) is a widely used pre-processing method that performs well in balancing
machine learning performance and fairness performance. RW adjusts the weights
for samples within each (group, label) combination, where these weights are
utilized in loss functions. However, RW is limited to considering only a single
sensitive attribute when mitigating bias and assumes that each sensitive
attribute is equally important. This may result in potential inaccuracies when
addressing intersectional bias. To address these limitations, we propose
M3Fair, a multi-level and multi-sensitive-attribute reweighting method by
extending the RW method to multiple sensitive attributes at multiple levels.
Our experiments on real-world datasets show that the approach is effective,
straightforward, and generalizable in addressing the healthcare fairness
issues.

    <title>Missingness as Stability: Understanding the Structure of Missingness in
  Longitudinal EHR data and its Impact on Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  There is an emerging trend in the reinforcement learning for healthcare
literature. In order to prepare longitudinal, irregularly sampled, clinical
datasets for reinforcement learning algorithms, many researchers will resample
the time series data to short, regular intervals and use
last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation to fill in these gaps.
Typically, they will not maintain any explicit information about which values
were imputed. In this work, we (1) call attention to this practice and discuss
its potential implications; (2) propose an alternative representation of the
patient state that addresses some of these issues; and (3) demonstrate in a
novel but representative clinical dataset that our alternative representation
yields consistently better results for achieving optimal control, as measured
by off-policy policy evaluation, compared to representations that do not
incorporate missingness information.

    <title>Deep Learning for Epidemiologists: An Introduction to Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to problems in medicine
and healthcare. However, few epidemiologists have received formal training in
these methods. To bridge this gap, this article introduces to the fundamentals
of deep learning from an epidemiological perspective. Specifically, this
article reviews core concepts in machine learning (overfitting, regularization,
hyperparameters), explains several fundamental deep learning architectures
(convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks), and summarizes
training, evaluation, and deployment of models. We aim to enable the reader to
engage with and critically evaluate medical applications of deep learning,
facilitating a dialogue between computer scientists and epidemiologists that
will improve the safety and efficacy of applications of this technology.

    <title>Distributed Learning Approaches for Automated Chest X-Ray Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  Deep Learning has established in the latest years as a successful approach to
address a great variety of tasks. Healthcare is one of the most promising field
of application for Deep Learning approaches since it would allow to help
clinicians to analyze patient data and perform diagnoses. However, despite the
vast amount of data collected every year in hospitals and other clinical
institutes, privacy regulations on sensitive data - such as those related to
health - pose a serious challenge to the application of these methods. In this
work, we focus on strategies to cope with privacy issues when a consortium of
healthcare institutions needs to train machine learning models for identifying
a particular disease, comparing the performances of two recent distributed
learning approaches - Federated Learning and Split Learning - on the task of
Automated Chest X-Ray Diagnosis. In particular, in our analysis we investigated
the impact of different data distributions in client data and the possible
policies on the frequency of data exchange between the institutions.

    <title>Dynamic Survival Analysis for Early Event Prediction</title>
    <summary>  This study advances Early Event Prediction (EEP) in healthcare through
Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA), offering a novel approach by integrating risk
localization into alarm policies to enhance clinical event metrics. By adapting
and evaluating DSA models against traditional EEP benchmarks, our research
demonstrates their ability to match EEP models on a time-step level and
significantly improve event-level metrics through a new alarm prioritization
scheme (up to 11% AuPRC difference). This approach represents a significant
step forward in predictive healthcare, providing a more nuanced and actionable
framework for early event prediction and management.

    <title>A blockchain-orchestrated Federated Learning architecture for healthcare
  consortia</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel architecture for federated learning within healthcare
consortia. At the heart of the solution is a unique integration of privacy
preserving technologies, built upon native enterprise blockchain components
available in the Ethereum ecosystem. We show how the specific characteristics
and challenges of healthcare consortia informed our design choices, notably the
conception of a new Secure Aggregation protocol assembled with a protected
hardware component and an encryption toolkit native to Ethereum. Our
architecture also brings in a privacy preserving audit trail that logs events
in the network without revealing identities.

    <title>Inferring Causal Direction from Observational Data: A Complexity
  Approach</title>
    <summary>  At the heart of causal structure learning from observational data lies a
deceivingly simple question: given two statistically dependent random
variables, which one has a causal effect on the other? This is impossible to
answer using statistical dependence testing alone and requires that we make
additional assumptions. We propose several fast and simple criteria for
distinguishing cause and effect in pairs of discrete or continuous random
variables. The intuition behind them is that predicting the effect variable
using the cause variable should be `simpler' than the reverse -- different
notions of `simplicity' giving rise to different criteria. We demonstrate the
accuracy of the criteria on synthetic data generated under a broad family of
causal mechanisms and types of noise.

    <title>FedBlockHealth: A Synergistic Approach to Privacy and Security in
  IoT-Enabled Healthcare through Federated Learning and Blockchain</title>
    <summary>  The rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare has
introduced new challenges in preserving data privacy, security and patient
safety. Traditional approaches need to ensure security and privacy while
maintaining computational efficiency, particularly for resource-constrained IoT
devices. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach combining federated
learning and blockchain technology to provide a secure and privacy-preserved
solution for IoT-enabled healthcare applications. Our approach leverages a
public-key cryptosystem that provides semantic security for local model
updates, while blockchain technology ensures the integrity of these updates and
enforces access control and accountability. The federated learning process
enables a secure model aggregation without sharing sensitive patient data. We
implement and evaluate our proposed framework using EMNIST datasets,
demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving data privacy and security while
maintaining computational efficiency. The results suggest that our hybrid
approach can significantly enhance the development of secure and
privacy-preserved IoT-enabled healthcare applications, offering a promising
direction for future research in this field.

    <title>Synthetic Patient Generation: A Deep Learning Approach Using Variational
  Autoencoders</title>
    <summary>  Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is a new and exciting frontier and the
possibilities are endless. With deep learning approaches beating human
performances in many areas, the logical next step is to attempt their
application in the health space. For these and other Machine Learning
approaches to produce good results and have their potential realized, the need
for, and importance of, large amounts of accurate data is second to none. This
is a challenge faced by many industries and more so in the healthcare space. We
present an approach of using Variational Autoencoders (VAE's) as an approach to
generating more data for training deeper networks, as well as uncovering
underlying patterns in diagnoses and the patients suffering from them. By
training a VAE, on available data, it was able to learn the latent distribution
of the patient features given the diagnosis. It is then possible, after
training, to sample from the learnt latent distribution to generate new
accurate patient records given the patient diagnosis.

    <title>Explainable AI for survival analysis: a median-SHAP approach</title>
    <summary>  With the adoption of machine learning into routine clinical practice comes
the need for Explainable AI methods tailored to medical applications. Shapley
values have sparked wide interest for locally explaining models. Here, we
demonstrate their interpretation strongly depends on both the summary statistic
and the estimator for it, which in turn define what we identify as an 'anchor
point'. We show that the convention of using a mean anchor point may generate
misleading interpretations for survival analysis and introduce median-SHAP, a
method for explaining black-box models predicting individual survival times.

    <title>Integrated multimodal artificial intelligence framework for healthcare
  applications</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise to improve healthcare
over the next decades. Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data
sources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver
more accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of
applications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in
Medicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI
systems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data
pre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted
for research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM
framework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on
HAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N=34,537 samples) containing
7,279 unique hospitalizations and 6,485 patients, spanning all possible input
combinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and
images), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this
framework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar
single-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6-33%),
including 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and
48-hour mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each
modality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the
heterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal
inputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties
and flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a
promising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and
operational healthcare settings.

    <title>Big Data Architecture in Czech Republic Healthcare Service:
  Requirements, TPC-H Benchmarks and Vertica</title>
    <summary>  Big data in healthcare has made a positive difference in advancing analytical
capabilities and lowering the costs of medical care. In addition to providing
analytical capabilities on platforms supporting current and near-future AI with
machine-learning and data-mining algorithms, there is also a need for ethical
considerations mandating new ways to preserve privacy, all of which are
preconditioned by the growing body of regulations and expectations. The purpose
of this study is to improve existing clinical care by implementing a big data
platform for the Czech Republic National Health Service. Based on the achieved
performance and its compliance with mandatory guidelines, the reported big-data
platform was selected as the winning solution from the Czech Republic national
tender (Tender Id. VZ0036628, No. Z2017-035520). The platform, based on
analytical Vertica NoSQL database for massive data processing, complies with
the TPC-H1 for decision support benchmark, the European Union (EU) and the
Czech Republic requirements, well-exceeding defined system performance
thresholds. The reported artefacts and concepts are transferrable to healthcare
systems in other countries and are intended to provide personalised autonomous
assessment from big data in a cost-effective, scalable and high-performance
manner. The implemented platform allows: (1) scalability; (2) further
implementations of newly-developed machine learning algorithms for
classification and predictive analytics; (3) security improvements related to
Electronic Health Records (EHR) by using automated functions for data
encryption and decryption; and (4) the use of big data to allow strategic
planning in healthcare.

    <title>Empowering Healthcare through Privacy-Preserving MRI Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In the healthcare domain, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assumes a pivotal
role, as it employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
methodologies to extract invaluable insights from imaging data. Nonetheless,
the imperative need for patient privacy poses significant challenges when
collecting data from diverse healthcare sources. Consequently, the Deep
Learning (DL) communities occasionally face difficulties detecting rare
features. In this research endeavor, we introduce the Ensemble-Based Federated
Learning (EBFL) Framework, an innovative solution tailored to address this
challenge. The EBFL framework deviates from the conventional approach by
emphasizing model features over sharing sensitive patient data. This unique
methodology fosters a collaborative and privacy-conscious environment for
healthcare institutions, empowering them to harness the capabilities of a
centralized server for model refinement while upholding the utmost data privacy
standards.Conversely, a robust ensemble architecture boasts potent feature
extraction capabilities, distinguishing itself from a single DL model. This
quality makes it remarkably dependable for MRI analysis. By harnessing our
groundbreaking EBFL methodology, we have achieved remarkable precision in the
classification of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and
non-tumor instances, attaining a precision rate of 94% for the Global model and
an impressive 96% for the Ensemble model. Our models underwent rigorous
evaluation using conventional performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision,
Recall, and F1 Score. Integrating DL within the Federated Learning (FL)
framework has yielded a methodology that offers precise and dependable
diagnostics for detecting brain tumors.

    <title>Leveraging Federated Learning for Automatic Detection of Clopidogrel
  Treatment Failures</title>
    <summary>  The effectiveness of clopidogrel, a widely used antiplatelet medication,
varies significantly among individuals, necessitating the development of
precise predictive models to optimize patient care. In this study, we leverage
federated learning strategies to address clopidogrel treatment failure
detection. Our research harnesses the collaborative power of multiple
healthcare institutions, allowing them to jointly train machine learning models
while safeguarding sensitive patient data. Utilizing the UK Biobank dataset,
which encompasses a vast and diverse population, we partitioned the data based
on geographic centers and evaluated the performance of federated learning. Our
results show that while centralized training achieves higher Area Under the
Curve (AUC) values and faster convergence, federated learning approaches can
substantially narrow this performance gap. Our findings underscore the
potential of federated learning in addressing clopidogrel treatment failure
detection, offering a promising avenue for enhancing patient care through
personalized treatment strategies while respecting data privacy. This study
contributes to the growing body of research on federated learning in healthcare
and lays the groundwork for secure and privacy-preserving predictive models for
various medical conditions.

    <title>GRAM: Graph-based Attention Model for Healthcare Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling
in healthcare, but two important challenges remain: -Data insufficiency:Often
in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep
learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. -Interpretation:The
representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention
Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical
information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the
ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its
ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive
performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various
methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential
diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to
the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely
observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for
predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.
Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned
by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits
intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level
concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.

    <title>Early Detection of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome Using Deep Learning
  Models</title>
    <summary>  The research titled "Early Detection of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome using
Deep Learning Models" addresses a pressing concern arising from the COVID-19
pandemic. Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome (PCFS) has become a significant health
issue affecting individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. This
study harnesses a robust dataset comprising 940 patients from diverse age
groups, whose medical records were collected from various hospitals in Iraq
over the years 2022, 2022, and 2023. The primary objective of this research is
to develop and evaluate deep learning models for the early detection of PCFS.
Leveraging the power of deep learning, these models are trained on a
comprehensive set of clinical and demographic features extracted from the
dataset. The goal is to enable timely identification of PCFS symptoms in
post-COVID-19 patients, which can lead to more effective interventions and
improved patient outcomes. The study's findings underscore the potential of
deep learning in healthcare, particularly in the context of COVID-19 recovery.
Early detection of PCFS can aid healthcare professionals in providing timely
care and support to affected individuals, potentially reducing the long-term
impact of this syndrome on their quality of life. This research contributes to
the growing body of knowledge surrounding COVID-19-related health complications
and highlights the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning
techniques for early diagnosis and intervention. Keywords: Early Detection,

    <title>Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for Health and Wellness
  applications: a tutorial</title>
    <summary>  Research on decision support applications in healthcare, such as those
related to diagnosis, prediction, treatment planning, etc., have seen
enormously increased interest recently. This development is thanks to the
increase in data availability as well as advances in artificial intelligence
and machine learning research. Highly promising research examples are published
daily. However, at the same time, there are some unrealistic expectations with
regards to the requirements for reliable development and objective validation
that is needed in healthcare settings. These expectations may lead to unmet
schedules and disappointments (or non-uptake) at the end-user side. It is the
aim of this tutorial to provide practical guidance on how to assess performance
reliably and efficiently and avoid common traps. Instead of giving a list of
do's and don't s, this tutorial tries to build a better understanding behind
these do's and don't s and presents both the most relevant performance
evaluation criteria as well as how to compute them. Along the way, we will
indicate common mistakes and provide references discussing various topics more
in-depth.

    <title>Prognosis Prediction in Covid-19 Patients from Lab Tests and X-ray Data
  through Randomized Decision Trees</title>
    <summary>  AI and Machine Learning can offer powerful tools to help in the fight against
Covid-19. In this paper we present a study and a concrete tool based on machine
learning to predict the prognosis of hospitalised patients with Covid-19. In
particular we address the task of predicting the risk of death of a patient at
different times of the hospitalisation, on the base of some demographic
information, chest X-ray scores and several laboratory findings. Our machine
learning models use ensembles of decision trees trained and tested using data
from more than 2000 patients. An experimental evaluation of the models shows
good performance in solving the addressed task.

    <title>Characterizing Pulmonary Fibrosis Patterns in Post-COVID-19 Patients
  through Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impact on global healthcare systems,
with increasing evidence of pulmonary fibrosis emerging as a post-infection
complication. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of pulmonary
fibrosis patterns in post-COVID-19 patients from South and Central Iraq,
employing advanced machine learning algorithms. Data were collected from 390
patients, and their medical records were systematically analyzed. Our findings
reveal distinct patterns of pulmonary fibrosis in this cohort, shedding light
on the heterogeneous nature of post-COVID-19 lung complications. Machine
learning models demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, offering valuable
insights into the characterization of fibrotic changes. The identification of
specific patterns contributes to early diagnosis and personalized treatment
strategies for affected individuals. This research underscores the importance
of data-driven approaches in understanding post-COVID-19 complications,
particularly in regions with unique demographic and healthcare characteristics.
It emphasizes the potential for machine learning to enhance clinical
decision-making and improve patient care in the aftermath of the pandemic.
Further investigations are warranted to validate these findings and explore
additional factors influencing pulmonary fibrosis in post-COVID-19 patients.

    <title>Anderson Acceleration For Bioinformatics-Based Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Anderson acceleration (AA) is a well-known method for accelerating the
convergence of iterative algorithms, with applications in various fields
including deep learning and optimization. Despite its popularity in these
areas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers has
not been thoroughly studied. Tabular data, in particular, presents a unique
challenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models are
known to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysis
of these models has received limited attention. To address this gap in
research, we implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant that
incorporates AA to speed up convergence. We evaluate the performance of our SVM
with and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biology
domain and demonstrate that the use of AA significantly improves convergence
and reduces the training loss as the number of iterations increases. Our
findings provide a promising perspective on the potential of Anderson
acceleration in the training of simple machine learning classifiers and
underscore the importance of further research in this area. By showing the
effectiveness of AA in this setting, we aim to inspire more studies that
explore the applications of AA in classical machine learning.

    <title>Natural Language Generation for Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  A variety of methods existing for generating synthetic electronic health
records (EHRs), but they are not capable of generating unstructured text, like
emergency department (ED) chief complaints, history of present illness or
progress notes. Here, we use the encoder-decoder model, a deep learning
algorithm that features in many contemporary machine translation systems, to
generate synthetic chief complaints from discrete variables in EHRs, like age
group, gender, and discharge diagnosis. After being trained end-to-end on
authentic records, the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that
preserves much of the epidemiological information in the original data. As a
side effect of the model's optimization goal, these synthetic chief complaints
are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings, and they
include none of the personally-identifiable information (PII) that was in the
training data, suggesting it may be used to support the de-identification of
text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial
networks (GANs), our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs,
facilitating data sharing between healthcare providers and researchers and
improving our ability to develop machine learning methods tailored to the
information in healthcare data.

    <title>Evaluating subgroup disparity using epistemic uncertainty in mammography</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning (ML) continue to be integrated into healthcare systems
that affect clinical decision making, new strategies will need to be
incorporated in order to effectively detect and evaluate subgroup disparities
to ensure accountability and generalizability in clinical workflows. In this
paper, we explore how epistemic uncertainty can be used to evaluate disparity
in patient demographics (race) and data acquisition (scanner) subgroups for
breast density assessment on a dataset of 108,190 mammograms collected from 33
clinical sites. Our results show that even if aggregate performance is
comparable, the choice of uncertainty quantification metric can significantly
the subgroup level. We hope this analysis can promote further work on how
uncertainty can be leveraged to increase transparency of machine learning
applications for clinical deployment.

    <title>The Road to Explainability is Paved with Bias: Measuring the Fairness of
  Explanations</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models in safety-critical settings like healthcare are often
blackboxes: they contain a large number of parameters which are not transparent
to users. Post-hoc explainability methods where a simple, human-interpretable
model imitates the behavior of these blackbox models are often proposed to help
users trust model predictions. In this work, we audit the quality of such
explanations for different protected subgroups using real data from four
settings in finance, healthcare, college admissions, and the US justice system.
Across two different blackbox model architectures and four popular
explainability methods, we find that the approximation quality of explanation
models, also known as the fidelity, differs significantly between subgroups. We
also demonstrate that pairing explainability methods with recent advances in
robust machine learning can improve explanation fairness in some settings.
However, we highlight the importance of communicating details of non-zero
fidelity gaps to users, since a single solution might not exist across all
settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of unfair explanation models as
a challenging and understudied problem facing the machine learning community.

    <title>Towards Interpretable Classification of Leukocytes based on Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Label-free approaches are attractive in cytological imaging due to their
flexibility and cost efficiency. They are supported by machine learning
methods, which, despite the lack of labeling and the associated lower contrast,
can classify cells with high accuracy where the human observer has little
chance to discriminate cells. In order to better integrate these workflows into
the clinical decision making process, this work investigates the calibration of
confidence estimation for the automated classification of leukocytes. In
addition, different visual explanation approaches are compared, which should
bring machine decision making closer to professional healthcare applications.
Furthermore, we were able to identify general detection patterns in neural
networks and demonstrate the utility of the presented approaches in different
scenarios of blood cell analysis.

    <title>Deploying clinical machine learning? Consider the following...</title>
    <summary>  Despite the intense attention and considerable investment into clinical
machine learning research, relatively few applications have been deployed at a
large-scale in a real-world clinical environment. While research is important
in advancing the state-of-the-art, translation is equally important in bringing
these techniques and technologies into a position to ultimately impact
healthcare. We believe a lack of appreciation for several considerations are a
major cause for this discrepancy between expectation and reality. To better
characterize a holistic perspective among researchers and practitioners, we
survey several practitioners with commercial experience in developing CML for
clinical deployment. Using these insights, we identify several main categories
of challenges in order to better design and develop clinical machine learning
applications.

    <title>Vertical Federated Knowledge Transfer via Representation Distillation
  for Healthcare Collaboration Networks</title>
    <summary>  Collaboration between healthcare institutions can significantly lessen the
imbalance in medical resources across various geographic areas. However,
directly sharing diagnostic information between institutions is typically not
permitted due to the protection of patients' highly sensitive privacy. As a
novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL)
makes it possible to maximize the data utility among multiple medical
institutions. These feature-enrichment FL techniques are referred to as
vertical FL (VFL). Traditional VFL can only benefit multi-parties' shared
samples, which strongly restricts its application scope. In order to improve
the information-sharing capability and innovation of various healthcare-related
institutions, and then to establish a next-generation open medical
collaboration network, we propose a unified framework for vertical federated
knowledge transfer mechanism (VFedTrans) based on a novel cross-hospital
representation distillation component. Specifically, our framework includes
three steps. First, shared samples' federated representations are extracted by
collaboratively modeling multi-parties' joint features with current efficient
vertical federated representation learning methods. Second, for each hospital,
we learn a local-representation-distilled module, which can transfer the
knowledge from shared samples' federated representations to enrich local
samples' representations. Finally, each hospital can leverage local samples'
representations enriched by the distillation module to boost arbitrary
downstream machine learning tasks. The experiments on real-life medical
datasets verify the knowledge transfer effectiveness of our framework.

    <title>HealthEdge: A Machine Learning-Based Smart Healthcare Framework for
  Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes in an Integrated IoT, Edge, and Cloud Computing
  System</title>
    <summary>  Diabetes Mellitus has no permanent cure to date and is one of the leading
causes of death globally. The alarming increase in diabetes calls for the need
to take precautionary measures to avoid/predict the occurrence of diabetes.
This paper proposes HealthEdge, a machine learning-based smart healthcare
framework for type 2 diabetes prediction in an integrated IoT-edge-cloud
computing system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried
out between the two most used machine learning algorithms in the literature,
Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR), using two real-life diabetes
datasets. The results show that RF predicts diabetes with 6% more accuracy on
average compared to LR.

    <title>Equity in Healthcare: Analyzing Disparities in Machine Learning
  Predictions of Diabetic Patient Readmissions</title>
    <summary>  This study investigates how machine learning (ML) models can predict hospital
readmissions for diabetic patients fairly and accurately across different
demographics (age, gender, race). We compared models like Deep Learning,
Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Naive Bayes.
GBM stood out with an F1-score of 84.3% and accuracy of 82.2%, accurately
predicting readmissions across demographics. A fairness analysis was conducted
across all the models. GBM minimized disparities in predictions, achieving
balanced results across genders and races. It showed low False Discovery Rates
(FDR) (6-7%) and False Positive Rates (FPR) (5%) for both genders.
Additionally, FDRs remained low for racial groups, such as African Americans
(8%) and Asians (7%). Similarly, FPRs were consistent across age groups (4%)
for both patients under 40 and those above 40, indicating its precision and
ability to reduce bias. These findings emphasize the importance of choosing ML
models carefully to ensure both accuracy and fairness for all patients. By
showcasing effectiveness of various models with fairness metrics, this study
promotes personalized medicine and the need for fair ML algorithms in
healthcare. This can ultimately reduce disparities and improve outcomes for
diabetic patients of all backgrounds.

    <title>Predicting Participation in Cancer Screening Programs with Machine
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present machine learning models based on random forest
classifiers, support vector machines, gradient boosted decision trees, and
artificial neural networks to predict participation in cancer screening
programs in South Korea. The top performing model was based on gradient boosted
decision trees and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.8706 and average precision of 0.8776. The results of this
study are encouraging and suggest that with further research, these models can
be directly applied to Korea's healthcare system, thus increasing participation
in Korea's National Cancer Screening Program.

    <title>Graph-in-Graph (GiG): Learning interpretable latent graphs in
  non-Euclidean domain for biological and healthcare applications</title>
    <summary>  Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing unstructured,
non-Euclidean data ubiquitous in the healthcare domain. Two prominent examples
are molecule property prediction and brain connectome analysis. Importantly,
recent works have shown that considering relationships between input data
samples have a positive regularizing effect for the downstream task in
healthcare applications. These relationships are naturally modeled by a
(possibly unknown) graph structure between input samples. In this work, we
propose Graph-in-Graph (GiG), a neural network architecture for protein
classification and brain imaging applications that exploits the graph
representation of the input data samples and their latent relation. We assume
an initially unknown latent-graph structure between graph-valued input data and
propose to learn end-to-end a parametric model for message passing within and
across input graph samples, along with the latent structure connecting the
input graphs. Further, we introduce a degree distribution loss that helps
regularize the predicted latent relationships structure. This regularization
can significantly improve the downstream task. Moreover, the obtained latent
graph can represent patient population models or networks of molecule clusters,
providing a level of interpretability and knowledge discovery in the input
domain of particular value in healthcare.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Healthcare Systems: A
  Comprehensive Survey</title>
    <summary>  The rapid increase in the percentage of chronic disease patients along with
the recent pandemic pose immediate threats on healthcare expenditure and
elevate causes of death. This calls for transforming healthcare systems away
from one-on-one patient treatment into intelligent health systems, to improve
services, access and scalability, while reducing costs. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has witnessed an intrinsic breakthrough in solving a variety of complex
problems for diverse applications and services. Thus, we conduct in this paper
a comprehensive survey of the recent models and techniques of RL that have been
developed/used for supporting Intelligent-healthcare (I-health) systems. This
paper can guide the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art regarding
the use of RL in the context of I-health. Specifically, we first present an
overview for the I-health systems challenges, architecture, and how RL can
benefit these systems. We then review the background and mathematical modeling
of different RL, Deep RL (DRL), and multi-agent RL models. After that, we
provide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health
systems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge
intelligence, smart core network, and dynamic treatment regimes. Finally, we
highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving
the future success of RL in I-health systems, which opens the door for
exploring some interesting and unsolved problems.

    <title>Propensity score prediction for electronic healthcare databases using
  Super Learner and High-dimensional Propensity Score Methods</title>
    <summary>  The optimal learner for prediction modeling varies depending on the
underlying data-generating distribution. Super Learner (SL) is a generic
ensemble learning algorithm that uses cross-validation to select among a
"library" of candidate prediction models. The SL is not restricted to a single
prediction model, but uses the strengths of a variety of learning algorithms to
adapt to different databases. While the SL has been shown to perform well in a
number of settings, it has not been thoroughly evaluated in large electronic
healthcare databases that are common in pharmacoepidemiology and comparative
effectiveness research. In this study, we applied and evaluated the performance
of the SL in its ability to predict treatment assignment using three electronic
healthcare databases. We considered a library of algorithms that consisted of
both nonparametric and parametric models. We also considered a novel strategy
for prediction modeling that combines the SL with the high-dimensional
propensity score (hdPS) variable selection algorithm. Predictive performance
was assessed using three metrics: the negative log-likelihood, area under the
curve (AUC), and time complexity. Results showed that the best individual
algorithm, in terms of predictive performance, varied across datasets. The SL
was able to adapt to the given dataset and optimize predictive performance
relative to any individual learner. Combining the SL with the hdPS was the most
consistent prediction method and may be promising for PS estimation and
prediction modeling in electronic healthcare databases.

    <title>Synthetic Data in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Synthetic data are becoming a critical tool for building artificially
intelligent systems. Simulators provide a way of generating data systematically
and at scale. These data can then be used either exclusively, or in conjunction
with real data, for training and testing systems. Synthetic data are
particularly attractive in cases where the availability of ``real'' training
examples might be a bottleneck. While the volume of data in healthcare is
growing exponentially, creating datasets for novel tasks and/or that reflect a
diverse set of conditions and causal relationships is not trivial. Furthermore,
these data are highly sensitive and often patient specific. Recent research has
begun to illustrate the potential for synthetic data in many areas of medicine,
but no systematic review of the literature exists. In this paper, we present
the cases for physical and statistical simulations for creating data and the
proposed applications in healthcare and medicine. We discuss that while
synthetics can promote privacy, equity, safety and continual and causal
learning, they also run the risk of introducing flaws, blind spots and
propagating or exaggerating biases.

    <title>Why we do need Explainable AI for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The recent spike in certified Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for
healthcare has renewed the debate around adoption of this technology. One
thread of such debate concerns Explainable AI and its promise to render AI
devices more transparent and trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical AI
space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI techniques,
questioning their use and inclusion in guidelines and standards. Revisiting
such criticisms, this article offers a balanced and comprehensive perspective
on the utility of Explainable AI, focusing on the specificity of clinical
applications of AI and placing them in the context of healthcare interventions.
Against its detractors and despite valid concerns, we argue that the
Explainable AI research program is still central to human-machine interaction
and ultimately our main tool against loss of control, a danger that cannot be
prevented by rigorous clinical validation alone.

    <title>Explainable Machine Learning System for Predicting Chronic Kidney
  Disease in High-Risk Cardiovascular Patients</title>
    <summary>  As the global population ages, the incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
is rising. CKD often remains asymptomatic until advanced stages, which
significantly burdens both the healthcare system and patient quality of life.
This research developed an explainable machine learning system for predicting
CKD in patients with cardiovascular risks, utilizing medical history and
laboratory data. The Random Forest model achieved the highest sensitivity of
88.2%. The study introduces a comprehensive explainability framework that
extends beyond traditional feature importance methods, incorporating global and
local interpretations, bias inspection, biomedical relevance, and safety
assessments. Key predictive features identified in global interpretation were
the use of diabetic and ACEI/ARB medications, and initial eGFR values. Local
interpretation provided model insights through counterfactual explanations,
which aligned with other system parts. After conducting a bias inspection, it
was found that the initial eGFR values and CKD predictions exhibited some bias,
but no significant gender bias was identified. The model's logic, extracted by
scoped rules, was confirmed to align with existing medical literature. The
safety assessment tested potentially dangerous cases and confirmed that the
model behaved safely. This system enhances the explainability, reliability, and
accountability of the model, promoting its potential integration into
healthcare settings and compliance with upcoming regulatory standards, and
showing promise for broader applications in healthcare machine learning.

    <title>SparseSense: Human Activity Recognition from Highly Sparse Sensor
  Data-streams Using Set-based Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Batteryless or so called passive wearables are providing new and innovative
methods for human activity recognition (HAR), especially in healthcare
applications for older people. Passive sensors are low cost, lightweight,
unobtrusive and desirably disposable; attractive attributes for healthcare
applications in hospitals and nursing homes. Despite the compelling
propositions for sensing applications, the data streams from these sensors are
characterised by high sparsity---the time intervals between sensor readings are
irregular while the number of readings per unit time are often limited. In this
paper, we rigorously explore the problem of learning activity recognition
models from temporally sparse data. We describe how to learn directly from
sparse data using a deep learning paradigm in an end-to-end manner. We
demonstrate significant classification performance improvements on real-world
passive sensor datasets from older people over the state-of-the-art deep
learning human activity recognition models. Further, we provide insights into
the model's behaviour through complementary experiments on a benchmark dataset
and visualisation of the learned activity feature spaces.

    <title>Towards More Efficient Data Valuation in Healthcare Federated Learning
  using Ensembling</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) wherein multiple institutions collaboratively train a
machine learning model without sharing data is becoming popular. Participating
institutions might not contribute equally, some contribute more data, some
better quality data or some more diverse data. To fairly rank the contribution
of different institutions, Shapley value (SV) has emerged as the method of
choice. Exact SV computation is impossibly expensive, especially when there are
hundreds of contributors. Existing SV computation techniques use
approximations. However, in healthcare where the number of contributing
institutions are likely not of a colossal scale, computing exact SVs is still
exorbitantly expensive, but not impossible. For such settings, we propose an
efficient SV computation technique called SaFE (Shapley Value for Federated
Learning using Ensembling). We empirically show that SaFE computes values that
are close to exact SVs, and that it performs better than current SV
approximations. This is particularly relevant in medical imaging setting where
widespread heterogeneity across institutions is rampant and fast accurate data
valuation is required to determine the contribution of each participant in
multi-institutional collaborative learning.

    <title>Multi-task Prediction of Disease Onsets from Longitudinal Lab Tests</title>
    <summary>  Disparate areas of machine learning have benefited from models that can take
raw data with little preprocessing as input and learn rich representations of
that raw data in order to perform well on a given prediction task. We evaluate
this approach in healthcare by using longitudinal measurements of lab tests,
one of the more raw signals of a patient's health state widely available in
clinical data, to predict disease onsets. In particular, we train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and two novel convolutional
neural networks for multi-task prediction of disease onset for 133 conditions
based on 18 common lab tests measured over time in a cohort of 298K patients
derived from 8 years of administrative claims data. We compare the neural
networks to a logistic regression with several hand-engineered, clinically
relevant features. We find that the representation-based learning approaches
significantly outperform this baseline. We believe that our work suggests a new
avenue for patient risk stratification based solely on lab results.

    <title>Time-Guided High-Order Attention Model of Longitudinal Heterogeneous
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Due to potential applications in chronic disease management and personalized
healthcare, the EHRs data analysis has attracted much attention of both
researchers and practitioners. There are three main challenges in modeling
longitudinal and heterogeneous EHRs data: heterogeneity, irregular temporality
and interpretability. A series of deep learning methods have made remarkable
progress in resolving these challenges. Nevertheless, most of existing
attention models rely on capturing the 1-order temporal dependencies or 2-order
multimodal relationships among feature elements. In this paper, we propose a
time-guided high-order attention (TGHOA) model. The proposed method has three
major advantages. (1) It can model longitudinal heterogeneous EHRs data via
capturing the 3-order correlations of different modalities and the irregular
temporal impact of historical events. (2) It can be used to identify the
potential concerns of medical features to explain the reasoning process of the
healthcare model. (3) It can be easily expanded into cases with more modalities
and flexibly applied in different prediction tasks. We evaluate the proposed
method in two tasks of mortality prediction and disease ranking on two real
world EHRs datasets. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of
the proposed model.

    <title>LogDoctor: an open and decentralized worker-centered solution for
  occupational management in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Occupational stress among health workers is a pervasive issue that affects
individual well-being, patient care quality, and healthcare systems'
sustainability. Current time-tracking solutions are mostly employer-driven,
neglecting the unique requirements of health workers. In turn, we propose an
open and decentralized worker-centered solution that leverages machine
intelligence for occupational health and safety monitoring. Its robust
technological stack, including blockchain technology and machine learning,
ensures compliance with legal frameworks for data protection and working time
regulations, while a decentralized autonomous organization bolsters distributed
governance. To tackle implementation challenges, we employ a scalable,
interoperable, and modular architecture while engaging diverse stakeholders
through open beta testing and pilot programs. By bridging an unaddressed
technological gap in healthcare, this approach offers a unique opportunity to
incentivize user adoption and align stakeholders' interests. We aim to empower
health workers to take control of their time, valorize their work, and
safeguard their health while enhancing the care of their patients.

    <title>A Naive Bayes machine learning approach to risk prediction using
  censored, time-to-event data</title>
    <summary>  Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical outcome is
a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians
and public health experts. Modern observational databases such as electronic
health records (EHRs) provide an alternative to the longitudinal cohort studies
traditionally used to construct risk models, bringing with them both
opportunities and challenges. Large sample sizes and detailed covariate
histories enable the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques to
uncover complex associations and interactions, but observational databases are
often ``messy,'' with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient
follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known Naive
Bayes (NB) machine learning approach for classification to time-to-event
outcomes subject to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our
method to the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk
prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to
prediction of cardiovascular risk using an EHR dataset from a large Midwest
integrated healthcare system.

    <title>A Novel Framework for Threat Analysis of Machine Learning-based Smart
  Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  Smart healthcare systems (SHSs) are providing fast and efficient disease
treatment leveraging wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) and implantable
medical devices (IMDs)-based internet of medical things (IoMT). In addition,
IoMT-based SHSs are enabling automated medication, allowing communication among
myriad healthcare sensor devices. However, adversaries can launch various
attacks on the communication network and the hardware/firmware to introduce
false data or cause data unavailability to the automatic medication system
endangering the patient's life. In this paper, we propose SHChecker, a novel
threat analysis framework that integrates machine learning and formal analysis
capabilities to identify potential attacks and corresponding effects on an
IoMT-based SHS. Our framework can provide us with all potential attack vectors,
each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered, for an SHS given
a specific set of attack attributes, allowing us to realize the system's
resiliency, thus the insight to enhance the robustness of the model. We
implement SHChecker on a synthetic and a real dataset, which affirms that our
framework can reveal potential attack vectors in an IoMT system. This is a
novel effort to formally analyze supervised and unsupervised machine learning
models for black-box SHS threat analysis.

    <title>Modeling the Uncertainty in Electronic Health Records: a Bayesian Deep
  Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have exhibited superior performance in predictive tasks
with the explosively increasing Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, due
to the lack of transparency, behaviors of deep learning models are difficult to
interpret. Without trustworthiness, deep learning models will not be able to
assist in the real-world decision-making process of healthcare issues. We
propose a deep learning model based on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) to
predict uncertainty induced by data noise. The uncertainty is introduced to
provide model predictions with an extra level of confidence. Our experiments
verify that instances with high uncertainty are harmful to model performance.
Moreover, by investigating the distributions of model prediction and
uncertainty, we show that it is possible to identify a group of patients for
timely intervention, such that decreasing data noise will benefit more on the
prediction accuracy for these patients.

    <title>Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Open Innovation Future on
  Digital Health</title>
    <summary>  Privacy protection is an ethical issue with broad concern in Artificial
Intelligence (AI). Federated learning is a new machine learning paradigm to
learn a shared model across users or organisations without direct access to the
data. It has great potential to be the next-general AI model training framework
that offers privacy protection and therefore has broad implications for the
future of digital health and healthcare informatics. Implementing an open
innovation framework in the healthcare industry, namely open health, is to
enhance innovation and creative capability of health-related organisations by
building a next-generation collaborative framework with partner organisations
and the research community. In particular, this game-changing collaborative
framework offers knowledge sharing from diverse data with a privacy-preserving.
This chapter will discuss how federated learning can enable the development of
an open health ecosystem with the support of AI. Existing challenges and
solutions for federated learning will be discussed.

    <title>Removing Confounding Factors Associated Weights in Deep Neural Networks
  Improves the Prediction Accuracy for Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  The proliferation of healthcare data has brought the opportunities of
applying data-driven approaches, such as machine learning methods, to assist
diagnosis. Recently, many deep learning methods have been shown with impressive
successes in predicting disease status with raw input data. However, the
"black-box" nature of deep learning and the high-reliability requirement of
biomedical applications have created new challenges regarding the existence of
confounding factors. In this paper, with a brief argument that inappropriate
handling of confounding factors will lead to models' sub-optimal performance in
real-world applications, we present an efficient method that can remove the
influences of confounding factors such as age or gender to improve the
across-cohort prediction accuracy of neural networks. One distinct advantage of
our method is that it only requires minimal changes of the baseline model's
architecture so that it can be plugged into most of the existing neural
networks. We conduct experiments across CT-scan, MRA, and EEG brain wave with
convolutional neural networks and LSTM to verify the efficiency of our method.

    <title>Graph-Based Deep Learning for Medical Diagnosis and Analysis: Past,
  Present and Future</title>
    <summary>  With the advances of data-driven machine learning research, a wide variety of
prediction problems have been tackled. It has become critical to explore how
machine learning and specifically deep learning methods can be exploited to
analyse healthcare data. A major limitation of existing methods has been the
focus on grid-like data; however, the structure of physiological recordings are
often irregular and unordered which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as
a matrix. As such, graph neural networks have attracted significant attention
by exploiting implicit information that resides in a biological system, with
interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights can be either temporal
associations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we thoroughly review the
different types of graph architectures and their applications in healthcare. We
provide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner, organized by their
domain of application including functional connectivity, anatomical structure
and electrical-based analysis. We also outline the limitations of existing
techniques and discuss potential directions for future research.

    <title>CohortNet: Empowering Cohort Discovery for Interpretable Healthcare
  Analytics</title>
    <summary>  Cohort studies are of significant importance in the field of healthcare
analysis. However, existing methods typically involve manual, labor-intensive,
and expert-driven pattern definitions or rely on simplistic clustering
techniques that lack medical relevance. Automating cohort studies with
interpretable patterns has great potential to facilitate healthcare analysis
but remains an unmet need in prior research efforts. In this paper, we propose
a cohort auto-discovery model, CohortNet, for interpretable healthcare
analysis, focusing on the effective identification, representation, and
exploitation of cohorts characterized by medically meaningful patterns.
CohortNet initially learns fine-grained patient representations by separately
processing each feature, considering both individual feature trends and feature
interactions at each time step. Subsequently, it classifies each feature into
distinct states and employs a heuristic cohort exploration strategy to
effectively discover substantial cohorts with concrete patterns. For each
identified cohort, it learns comprehensive cohort representations with credible
evidence through associated patient retrieval. Ultimately, given a new patient,
CohortNet can leverage relevant cohorts with distinguished importance, which
can provide a more holistic understanding of the patient's conditions.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and offers interpretable
insights from diverse perspectives in a top-down fashion.

    <title>Representation Learning of EHR Data via Graph-Based Medical Entity
  Embedding</title>
    <summary>  Automatic representation learning of key entities in electronic health record
(EHR) data is a critical step for healthcare informatics that turns
heterogeneous medical records into structured and actionable information. Here
we propose ME2Vec, an algorithmic framework for learning low-dimensional
vectors of the most common entities in EHR: medical services, doctors, and
patients. ME2Vec leverages diverse graph embedding techniques to cater for the
unique characteristic of each medical entity. Using real-world clinical data,
we demonstrate the efficacy of ME2Vec over competitive baselines on disease
diagnosis prediction.

    <title>Lessons Learned from EXMOS User Studies: A Technical Report Summarizing
  Key Takeaways from User Studies Conducted to Evaluate The EXMOS Platform</title>
    <summary>  In the realm of interactive machine-learning systems, the provision of
explanations serves as a vital aid in the processes of debugging and enhancing
prediction models. However, the extent to which various global model-centric
and data-centric explanations can effectively assist domain experts in
detecting and resolving potential data-related issues for the purpose of model
improvement has remained largely unexplored. In this technical report, we
summarise the key findings of our two user studies. Our research involved a
comprehensive examination of the impact of global explanations rooted in both
data-centric and model-centric perspectives within systems designed to support
healthcare experts in optimising machine learning models through both automated
and manual data configurations. To empirically investigate these dynamics, we
conducted two user studies, comprising quantitative analysis involving a sample
size of 70 healthcare experts and qualitative assessments involving 30
healthcare experts. These studies were aimed at illuminating the influence of
different explanation types on three key dimensions: trust, understandability,
and model improvement. Results show that global model-centric explanations
alone are insufficient for effectively guiding users during the intricate
process of data configuration. In contrast, data-centric explanations exhibited
their potential by enhancing the understanding of system changes that occur
post-configuration. However, a combination of both showed the highest level of
efficacy for fostering trust, improving understandability, and facilitating
model enhancement among healthcare experts. We also present essential
implications for developing interactive machine-learning systems driven by
explanations. These insights can guide the creation of more effective systems
that empower domain experts to harness the full potential of machine learning

    <title>Mixture-of-experts VAEs can disregard variation in surjective multimodal
  data</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning systems are often deployed in domains that entail data from
multiple modalities, for example, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics
describe patients in healthcare. Previous works have developed multimodal
variational autoencoders (VAEs) that generate several modalities. We consider
subjective data, where single datapoints from one modality (such as class
labels) describe multiple datapoints from another modality (such as images). We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that multimodal VAEs with a mixture
of experts posterior can struggle to capture variability in such surjective
data.

    <title>FLamby: Datasets and Benchmarks for Cross-Silo Federated Learning in
  Realistic Healthcare Settings</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) is a novel approach enabling several clients holding
sensitive data to collaboratively train machine learning models, without
centralizing data. The cross-silo FL setting corresponds to the case of few
($2$--$50$) reliable clients, each holding medium to large datasets, and is
typically found in applications such as healthcare, finance, or industry. While
previous works have proposed representative datasets for cross-device FL, few
realistic healthcare cross-silo FL datasets exist, thereby slowing algorithmic
research in this critical application. In this work, we propose a novel
cross-silo dataset suite focused on healthcare, FLamby (Federated Learning
AMple Benchmark of Your cross-silo strategies), to bridge the gap between
theory and practice of cross-silo FL. FLamby encompasses 7 healthcare datasets
with natural splits, covering multiple tasks, modalities, and data volumes,
each accompanied with baseline training code. As an illustration, we
additionally benchmark standard FL algorithms on all datasets. Our flexible and
modular suite allows researchers to easily download datasets, reproduce results
and re-use the different components for their research. FLamby is available
at~\url{www.github.com/owkin/flamby}.

    <title>Enhancing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction with Machine Learning
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global cause of mortality,
necessitating accurate risk prediction tools. Traditional methods, such as
QRISK and the Framingham heart score, exhibit limitations in their ability to
incorporate comprehensive patient data, potentially resulting in incomplete
risk factor consideration. To address these shortcomings, this study conducts a
meticulous review focusing on the application of machine learning models to
enhance predictive accuracy. Machine learning models, such as support vector
machines, and Random Forest, as well as deep learning techniques like
convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have emerged as
promising alternatives. These models offer superior performance, accommodating
a broader spectrum of variables and providing precise subgroup-specific
predictions. While machine learning integration holds promise for enhancing
risk assessment, it presents challenges such as data requirements and
computational constraints. Additionally, large language models have
revolutionised healthcare applications, augmenting diagnostic precision and
patient care. This study examines the core aspects of cardiovascular disease
event risk and presents a thorough review of traditional and machine learning
models, alongside deep learning techniques, for improved accuracy. It offers a
comprehensive survey of relevant datasets, critically compares ML models with
conventional approaches, and synthesizes key findings, highlighting their
implications for clinical practice. Furthermore, the potential of machine
learning and large language models in cardiovascular medicine is undeniable.
However, rigorous validation and optimisation are imperative before widespread
application in healthcare. This integration promises more accurate and
personalised cardiovascular care.

    <title>PAGE: Domain-Incremental Adaptation with Past-Agnostic Generative Replay
  for Smart Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  We propose PAGE, a domain-incremental adaptation strategy with past-agnostic
generative replay for smart healthcare. PAGE enables generative replay without
the aid of any preserved data or information from prior domains. When adapting
to a new domain, it exploits real data from the new distribution and the
current model to generate synthetic data that retain the learned knowledge of
previous domains. By replaying the synthetic data with the new real data during
training, PAGE achieves a good balance between domain adaptation and knowledge
retention. In addition, we incorporate an extended inductive conformal
prediction (EICP) method into PAGE to produce a confidence score and a
credibility value for each detection result. This makes the predictions
interpretable and provides statistical guarantees for disease detection in
smart healthcare applications. We demonstrate PAGE's effectiveness in
domain-incremental disease detection with three distinct disease datasets
collected from commercially available WMSs. PAGE achieves highly competitive
performance against state-of-the-art with superior scalability, data privacy,
and feasibility. Furthermore, PAGE can enable up to 75% reduction in clinical
workload with the help of EICP.

    <title>A smartphone based multi input workflow for non-invasive estimation of
  haemoglobin levels using machine learning techniques</title>
    <summary>  We suggest a low cost, non invasive healthcare system that measures
haemoglobin levels in patients and can be used as a preliminary diagnostic test
for anaemia. A combination of image processing, machine learning and deep
learning techniques are employed to develop predictive models to measure
haemoglobin levels. This is achieved through the color analysis of the
fingernail beds, palpebral conjunctiva and tongue of the patients. This
predictive model is then encapsulated in a healthcare application. This
application expedites data collection and facilitates active learning of the
model. It also incorporates personalized calibration of the model for each
patient, assisting in the continual monitoring of the haemoglobin levels of the
patient. Upon validating this framework using data, it can serve as a highly
accurate preliminary diagnostic test for anaemia.

    <title>Machine Learning Framework: Competitive Intelligence and Key Drivers
  Identification of Market Share Trends Among Healthcare Facilities</title>
    <summary>  The necessity of data driven decisions in healthcare strategy formulation is
rapidly increasing. A reliable framework which helps identify factors impacting
a Healthcare Provider Facility or a Hospital (from here on termed as Facility)
Market Share is of key importance. This pilot study aims at developing a data
driven Machine Learning - Regression framework which aids strategists in
formulating key decisions to improve the Facilitys Market Share which in turn
impacts in improving the quality of healthcare services. The US (United States)
healthcare business is chosen for the study; and the data spanning across 60
key Facilities in Washington State and about 3 years of historical data is
considered. In the current analysis Market Share is termed as the ratio of
facility encounters to the total encounters among the group of potential
competitor facilities. The current study proposes a novel two-pronged approach
of competitor identification and regression approach to evaluate and predict
market share, respectively. Leveraged model agnostic technique, SHAP, to
quantify the relative importance of features impacting the market share. The
proposed method to identify pool of competitors in current analysis, develops
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), feature level word vectors and evaluates the
key connected components at facility level. This technique is robust since its
data driven which minimizes the bias from empirical techniques. Post
identifying the set of competitors among facilities, developed Regression model
to predict the Market share. For relative quantification of features at a
facility level, incorporated SHAP a model agnostic explainer. This helped to
identify and rank the attributes at each facility which impacts the market
share.

    <title>Class-Incremental Continual Learning for General Purpose Healthcare
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare clinics regularly encounter dynamic data that changes due to
variations in patient populations, treatment policies, medical devices, and
emerging disease patterns. Deep learning models can suffer from catastrophic
forgetting when fine-tuned in such scenarios, causing poor performance on
previously learned tasks. Continual learning allows learning on new tasks
without performance drop on previous tasks. In this work, we investigate the
performance of continual learning models on four different medical imaging
scenarios involving ten classification datasets from diverse modalities,
clinical specialties, and hospitals. We implement various continual learning
approaches and evaluate their performance in these scenarios. Our results
demonstrate that a single model can sequentially learn new tasks from different
specialties and achieve comparable performance to naive methods. These findings
indicate the feasibility of recycling or sharing models across the same or
different medical specialties, offering another step towards the development of
general-purpose medical imaging AI that can be shared across institutions.

    <title>Viability of machine learning to reduce workload in systematic review
  screenings in the health sciences: a working paper</title>
    <summary>  Systematic reviews, which summarize and synthesize all the current research
in a specific topic, are a crucial component to academia. They are especially
important in the biomedical and health sciences, where they synthesize the
state of medical evidence and conclude the best course of action for various
diseases, pathologies, and treatments. Due to the immense amount of literature
that exists, as well as the output rate of research, reviewing abstracts can be
a laborious process. Automation may be able to significantly reduce this
workload. Of course, such classifications are not easily automated due to the
peculiar nature of written language. Machine learning may be able to help. This
paper explored the viability and effectiveness of using machine learning
modelling to classify abstracts according to specific exclusion/inclusion
criteria, as would be done in the first stage of a systematic review. The
specific task was performing the classification of deciding whether an abstract
is a randomized control trial (RCT) or not, a very common classification made
in systematic reviews in the healthcare field. Random training/testing splits
of an n=2042 dataset of labelled abstracts were repeatedly created (1000 times
in total), with a model trained and tested on each of these instances. A Bayes
classifier as well as an SVM classifier were used, and compared to non-machine
learning, simplistic approaches to textual classification. An SVM classifier
was seen to be highly effective, yielding a 90% accuracy, as well as an F1
score of 0.84, and yielded a potential workload reduction of 70%. This shows
that machine learning has the potential to significantly revolutionize the
abstract screening process in healthcare systematic reviews.

    <title>Learning Robust Features using Deep Learning for Automatic Seizure
  Detection</title>
    <summary>  We present and evaluate the capacity of a deep neural network to learn robust
features from EEG to automatically detect seizures. This is a challenging
problem because seizure manifestations on EEG are extremely variable both
inter- and intra-patient. By simultaneously capturing spectral, temporal and
spatial information our recurrent convolutional neural network learns a general
spatially invariant representation of a seizure. The proposed approach exceeds
significantly previous results obtained on cross-patient classifiers both in
terms of sensitivity and false positive rate. Furthermore, our model proves to
be robust to missing channel and variable electrode montage.

    <title>Self-explaining Neural Network with Concept-based Explanations for ICU
  Mortality Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Complex deep learning models show high prediction tasks in various clinical
prediction tasks but their inherent complexity makes it more challenging to
explain model predictions for clinicians and healthcare providers. Existing
research on explainability of deep learning models in healthcare have two major
limitations: using post-hoc explanations and using raw clinical variables as
units of explanation, both of which are often difficult for human
interpretation. In this work, we designed a self-explaining deep learning
framework using the expert-knowledge driven clinical concepts or intermediate
features as units of explanation. The self-explaining nature of our proposed
model comes from generating both explanations and predictions within the same
architectural framework via joint training. We tested our proposed approach on
a publicly available Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset for predicting
patient mortality in the ICU. In order to analyze the
performance-interpretability trade-off, we compared our proposed model with a
baseline having the same set-up but without the explanation components.
Experimental results suggest that adding explainability components to a deep
learning framework does not impact prediction performance and the explanations
generated by the model can provide insights to the clinicians to understand the
possible reasons behind patient mortality.

    <title>Unlocking the Potential of Medical Imaging with ChatGPT's Intelligent
  Diagnostics</title>
    <summary>  Medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing various healthcare
diseases and conditions. However, analyzing medical images is a complex and
time-consuming task that requires expertise and experience. This article aims
to design a decision support system to assist healthcare providers and patients
in making decisions about diagnosing, treating, and managing health conditions.
The proposed architecture contains three stages: 1) data collection and
labeling, 2) model training, and 3) diagnosis report generation. The key idea
is to train a deep learning model on a medical image dataset to extract four
types of information: the type of image scan, the body part, the test image,
and the results. This information is then fed into ChatGPT to generate
automatic diagnostics. The proposed system has the potential to enhance
decision-making, reduce costs, and improve the capabilities of healthcare
providers. The efficacy of the proposed system is analyzed by conducting
extensive experiments on a large medical image dataset. The experimental
outcomes exhibited promising performance for automatic diagnosis through
medical images.

    <title>Learning how to approve updates to machine learning algorithms in
  non-stationary settings</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning algorithms in healthcare have the potential to continually
learn from real-world data generated during healthcare delivery and adapt to
dataset shifts. As such, the FDA is looking to design policies that can
autonomously approve modifications to machine learning algorithms while
maintaining or improving the safety and effectiveness of the deployed models.
However, selecting a fixed approval strategy, a priori, can be difficult
because its performance depends on the stationarity of the data and the quality
of the proposed modifications. To this end, we investigate a
learning-to-approve approach (L2A) that uses accumulating monitoring data to
learn how to approve modifications. L2A defines a family of strategies that
vary in their "optimism''---where more optimistic policies have faster approval
rates---and searches over this family using an exponentially weighted average
forecaster. To control the cumulative risk of the deployed model, we give L2A
the option to abstain from making a prediction and incur some fixed abstention
cost instead. We derive bounds on the average risk of the model deployed by
L2A, assuming the distributional shifts are smooth. In simulation studies and
empirical analyses, L2A tailors the level of optimism for each problem-setting:
It learns to abstain when performance drops are common and approve beneficial
modifications quickly when the distribution is stable.

    <title>Convolutional Motif Kernel Networks</title>
    <summary>  Artificial neural networks show promising performance in detecting
correlations within data that are associated with specific outcomes. However,
the black-box nature of such models can hinder the knowledge advancement in
research fields by obscuring the decision process and preventing scientist to
fully conceptualize predicted outcomes. Furthermore, domain experts like
healthcare providers need explainable predictions to assess whether a predicted
outcome can be trusted in high stakes scenarios and to help them integrating a
model into their own routine. Therefore, interpretable models play a crucial
role for the incorporation of machine learning into high stakes scenarios like
healthcare. In this paper we introduce Convolutional Motif Kernel Networks, a
neural network architecture that involves learning a feature representation
within a subspace of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the position-aware
motif kernel function. The resulting model enables to directly interpret and
evaluate prediction outcomes by providing a biologically and medically
meaningful explanation without the need for additional post-hoc analysis. We
show that our model is able to robustly learn on small datasets and reaches
state-of-the-art performance on relevant healthcare prediction tasks. Our
proposed method can be utilized on DNA and protein sequences. Furthermore, we
show that the proposed method learns biologically meaningful concepts directly
from data using an end-to-end learning scheme.

    <title>Self-Attention Based Molecule Representation for Predicting Drug-Target
  Interaction</title>
    <summary>  Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential part of the drug
discovery process, which is an expensive process in terms of time and cost.
Therefore, reducing DTI cost could lead to reduced healthcare costs for a
patient. In addition, a precisely learned molecule representation in a DTI
model could contribute to developing personalized medicine, which will help
many patient cohorts. In this paper, we propose a new molecule representation
based on the self-attention mechanism, and a new DTI model using our molecule
representation. The experiments show that our DTI model outperforms the state
of the art by up to 4.9% points in terms of area under the precision-recall
curve. Moreover, a study using the DrugBank database proves that our model
effectively lists all known drugs targeting a specific cancer biomarker in the
top-30 candidate list.

    <title>Fairness With Minimal Harm: A Pareto-Optimal Approach For Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Common fairness definitions in machine learning focus on balancing notions of
disparity and utility. In this work, we study fairness in the context of risk
disparity among sub-populations. We are interested in learning models that
minimize performance discrepancies across sensitive groups without causing
unnecessary harm. This is relevant to high-stakes domains such as healthcare,
where non-maleficence is a core principle. We formalize this objective using
Pareto frontiers, and provide analysis, based on recent works in fairness, to
exemplify scenarios were perfect fairness might not be feasible without doing
unnecessary harm. We present a methodology for training neural networks that
achieve our goal by dynamically re-balancing subgroups risks. We argue that
even in domains where fairness at cost is required, finding a
non-unnecessary-harm fairness model is the optimal initial step. We demonstrate
this methodology on real case-studies of predicting ICU patient mortality, and
classifying skin lesions from dermatoscopic images.

    <title>A review of Generative Adversarial Networks for Electronic Health
  Records: applications, evaluation measures and data sources</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a valuable asset to facilitate clinical
research and point of care applications; however, many challenges such as data
privacy concerns impede its optimal utilization. Deep generative models,
particularly, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show great promise in
generating synthetic EHR data by learning underlying data distributions while
achieving excellent performance and addressing these challenges. This work aims
to review the major developments in various applications of GANs for EHRs and
provides an overview of the proposed methodologies. For this purpose, we
combine perspectives from healthcare applications and machine learning
techniques in terms of source datasets and the fidelity and privacy evaluation
of the generated synthetic datasets. We also compile a list of the metrics and
datasets used by the reviewed works, which can be utilized as benchmarks for
future research in the field. We conclude by discussing challenges in GANs for
EHRs development and proposing recommended practices. We hope that this work
motivates novel research development directions in the intersection of
healthcare and machine learning.

    <title>Interpretable Medical Imagery Diagnosis with Self-Attentive
  Transformers: A Review of Explainable AI for Health Care</title>
    <summary>  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have facilitated its
widespread adoption in primary medical services, addressing the demand-supply
imbalance in healthcare. Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as
state-of-the-art computer vision models, benefiting from self-attention
modules. However, compared to traditional machine-learning approaches,
deep-learning models are complex and are often treated as a "black box" that
can cause uncertainty regarding how they operate. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) refers to methods that explain and interpret machine
learning models' inner workings and how they come to decisions, which is
especially important in the medical domain to guide the healthcare
decision-making process. This review summarises recent ViT advancements and
interpretative approaches to understanding the decision-making process of ViT,
enabling transparency in medical diagnosis applications.

    <title>When Performance is not Enough -- A Multidisciplinary View on Clinical
  Decision Support</title>
    <summary>  Scientific publications about machine learning in healthcare are often about
implementing novel methods and boosting the performance - at least from a
computer science perspective. However, beyond such often short-lived
improvements, much more needs to be taken into consideration if we want to
arrive at a sustainable progress in healthcare. What does it take to actually
implement such a system, make it usable for the domain expert, and possibly
bring it into practical usage? Targeted at Computer Scientists, this work
presents a multidisciplinary view on machine learning in medical decision
support systems and covers information technology, medical, as well as ethical
aspects. Along with an implemented risk prediction system in nephrology,
challenges and lessons learned in a pilot project are presented.

    <title>Machine Learning for Administrative Health Records: A Systematic Review
  of Techniques and Applications</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning provides many powerful and effective techniques for
analysing heterogeneous electronic health records (EHR). Administrative Health
Records (AHR) are a subset of EHR collected for administrative purposes, and
the use of machine learning on AHRs is a growing subfield of EHR analytics.
Existing reviews of EHR analytics emphasise that the data-modality of the EHR
limits the breadth of suitable machine learning techniques, and pursuable
healthcare applications. Despite emphasising the importance of data modality,
the literature fails to analyse which techniques and applications are relevant
to AHRs. AHRs contain uniquely well-structured, categorically encoded records
which are distinct from other data-modalities captured by EHRs, and they can
provide valuable information pertaining to how patients interact with the
healthcare system.
  This paper systematically reviews AHR-based research, analysing 70 relevant
studies and spanning multiple databases. We identify and analyse which machine
learning techniques are applied to AHRs and which health informatics
applications are pursued in AHR-based research. We also analyse how these
techniques are applied in pursuit of each application, and identify the
limitations of these approaches. We find that while AHR-based studies are
disconnected from each other, the use of AHRs in health informatics research is
substantial and accelerating. Our synthesis of these studies highlights the
utility of AHRs for pursuing increasingly complex and diverse research
objectives despite a number of pervading data- and technique-based limitations.
Finally, through our findings, we propose a set of future research directions
that can enhance the utility of AHR data and machine learning techniques for
health informatics research.

    <title>Using massive health insurance claims data to predict very high-cost
  claimants: a machine learning approach</title>
    <summary>  Due to escalating healthcare costs, accurately predicting which patients will
incur high costs is an important task for payers and providers of healthcare.
High-cost claimants (HiCCs) are patients who have annual costs above
$\$250,000$ and who represent just 0.16% of the insured population but
currently account for 9% of all healthcare costs. In this study, we aimed to
develop a high-performance algorithm to predict HiCCs to inform a novel care
management system. Using health insurance claims from 48 million people and
augmented with census data, we applied machine learning to train binary
classification models to calculate the personal risk of HiCC. To train the
models, we developed a platform starting with 6,006 variables across all
clinical and demographic dimensions and constructed over one hundred candidate
models. The best model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 91.2%. The model exceeds the highest published
performance (84%) and remains high for patients with no prior history of
high-cost status (89%), who have less than a full year of enrollment (87%), or
lack pharmacy claims data (88%). It attains an area under the precision-recall
curve of 23.1%, and precision of 74% at a threshold of 0.99. A care management
program enrolling 500 people with the highest HiCC risk is expected to treat
199 true HiCCs and generate a net savings of $\$7.3$ million per year. Our
results demonstrate that high-performing predictive models can be constructed
using claims data and publicly available data alone, even for rare high-cost
claimants exceeding $\$250,000$. Our model demonstrates the transformational
power of machine learning and artificial intelligence in care management, which
would allow healthcare payers and providers to introduce the next generation of
care management programs.

    <title>Set Functions for Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Despite the eminent successes of deep neural networks, many architectures are
often hard to transfer to irregularly-sampled and asynchronous time series that
commonly occur in real-world datasets, especially in healthcare applications.
This paper proposes a novel approach for classifying irregularly-sampled time
series with unaligned measurements, focusing on high scalability and data
efficiency. Our method SeFT (Set Functions for Time Series) is based on recent
advances in differentiable set function learning, extremely parallelizable with
a beneficial memory footprint, thus scaling well to large datasets of long time
series and online monitoring scenarios. Furthermore, our approach permits
quantifying per-observation contributions to the classification outcome. We
extensively compare our method with existing algorithms on multiple healthcare
time series datasets and demonstrate that it performs competitively whilst
significantly reducing runtime.

    <title>Continuous Time Evidential Distributions for Irregular Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Prevalent in many real-world settings such as healthcare, irregular time
series are challenging to formulate predictions from. It is difficult to infer
the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it
could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To
characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an
evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This
distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially
observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty
temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT
attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks
and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.

    <title>Hippocrates: An Open-Source Framework for Advancing Large Language
  Models in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises to
transform medical diagnostics, research, and patient care. Yet, the progression
of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous
evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict
academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is
essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging
innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM
framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to
previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets,
codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed
to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon,
refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem.
Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical
domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training,
instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our
models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even
surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock
the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient
care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making
them available across the globe.

    <title>MedISure: Towards Assuring Machine Learning-based Medical Image
  Classifiers using Mixup Boundary Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) models are becoming integral in healthcare
technologies, presenting a critical need for formal assurance to validate their
safety, fairness, robustness, and trustworthiness. These models are inherently
prone to errors, potentially posing serious risks to patient health and could
even cause irreparable harm. Traditional software assurance techniques rely on
fixed code and do not directly apply to ML models since these algorithms are
adaptable and learn from curated datasets through a training process. However,
adapting established principles, such as boundary testing using synthetic test
data can effectively bridge this gap. To this end, we present a novel technique
called Mix-Up Boundary Analysis (MUBA) that facilitates evaluating image
classifiers in terms of prediction fairness. We evaluated MUBA for two
important medical imaging tasks -- brain tumour classification and breast
cancer classification -- and achieved promising results. This research aims to
showcase the importance of adapting traditional assurance principles for
assessing ML models to enhance the safety and reliability of healthcare
technologies. To facilitate future research, we plan to publicly release our
code for MUBA.

    <title>Non-Imaging Medical Data Synthesis for Trustworthy AI: A Comprehensive
  Survey</title>
    <summary>  Data quality is the key factor for the development of trustworthy AI in
healthcare. A large volume of curated datasets with controlled confounding
factors can help improve the accuracy, robustness and privacy of downstream AI
algorithms. However, access to good quality datasets is limited by the
technical difficulty of data acquisition and large-scale sharing of healthcare
data is hindered by strict ethical restrictions. Data synthesis algorithms,
which generate data with a similar distribution as real clinical data, can
serve as a potential solution to address the scarcity of good quality data
during the development of trustworthy AI. However, state-of-the-art data
synthesis algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, focus more on
imaging data while neglecting the synthesis of non-imaging healthcare data,
including clinical measurements, medical signals and waveforms, and electronic
healthcare records (EHRs). Thus, in this paper, we will review the synthesis
algorithms, particularly for non-imaging medical data, with the aim of
providing trustworthy AI in this domain. This tutorial-styled review paper will
provide comprehensive descriptions of non-imaging medical data synthesis on
aspects including algorithms, evaluations, limitations and future research
directions.

    <title>ManyDG: Many-domain Generalization for Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  The vast amount of health data has been continuously collected for each
patient, providing opportunities to support diverse healthcare predictive tasks
such as seizure detection and hospitalization prediction. Existing models are
mostly trained on other patients data and evaluated on new patients. Many of
them might suffer from poor generalizability. One key reason can be overfitting
due to the unique information related to patient identities and their data
collection environments, referred to as patient covariates in the paper. These
patient covariates usually do not contribute to predicting the targets but are
often difficult to remove. As a result, they can bias the model training
process and impede generalization. In healthcare applications, most existing
domain generalization methods assume a small number of domains. In this paper,
considering the diversity of patient covariates, we propose a new setting by
treating each patient as a separate domain (leading to many domains). We
develop a new domain generalization method ManyDG, that can scale to such
many-domain problems. Our method identifies the patient domain covariates by
mutual reconstruction and removes them via an orthogonal projection step.
Extensive experiments show that ManyDG can boost the generalization performance
on multiple real-world healthcare tasks (e.g., 3.7% Jaccard improvements on
MIMIC drug recommendation) and support realistic but challenging settings such
as insufficient data and continuous learning.

    <title>GP-VAE: Deep Probabilistic Time Series Imputation</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time series with missing values are common in areas such as
healthcare and finance, and have grown in number and complexity over the years.
This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform
classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications
of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack
interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for
dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple
and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional
representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process.
The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is
achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational
approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical
and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from
the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the
smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty
estimates.

    <title>CollaFuse: Navigating Limited Resources and Privacy in Collaborative
  Generative AI</title>
    <summary>  In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based
models present challenges for socio-technical systems in data requirements and
privacy. Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning
process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources
(e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse,
a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and
collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse
enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational
burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU
processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally
expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context,
CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive
information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various
application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare
research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed
machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.

    <title>Analyzing Wearables Dataset to Predict ADLs and Falls: A Pilot Study</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare is an important aspect of human life. Use of technologies in
healthcare has increased manifolds after the pandemic. Internet of Things based
systems and devices proposed in literature can help elders, children and adults
facing/experiencing health problems. This paper exhaustively reviews
thirty-nine wearable based datasets which can be used for evaluating the system
to recognize Activities of Daily Living and Falls. A comparative analysis on
the SisFall dataset using five machine learning methods i.e., Logistic
Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and
Naive Bayes is performed in python. The dataset is modified in two ways, in
first all the attributes present in dataset are used as it is and labelled in
binary form. In second, magnitude of three axes(x,y,z) for three sensors value
are computed and then used in experiment with label attribute. The experiments
are performed on one subject, ten subjects and all the subjects and compared in
terms of accuracy, precision and recall. The results obtained from this study
proves that KNN outperforms other machine learning methods in terms of
accuracy, precision and recall. It is also concluded that personalization of
data improves accuracy.

    <title>ACDC: $α$-Carving Decision Chain for Risk Stratification</title>
    <summary>  In many healthcare settings, intuitive decision rules for risk stratification
can help effective hospital resource allocation. This paper introduces a novel
variant of decision tree algorithms that produces a chain of decisions, not a
general tree. Our algorithm, $\alpha$-Carving Decision Chain (ACDC),
sequentially carves out "pure" subsets of the majority class examples. The
resulting chain of decision rules yields a pure subset of the minority class
examples. Our approach is particularly effective in exploring large and
class-imbalanced health datasets. Moreover, ACDC provides an interactive
interpretation in conjunction with visual performance metrics such as Receiver
Operating Characteristics curve and Lift chart.

    <title>VisioRed: A Visualisation Tool for Interpretable Predictive Maintenance</title>
    <summary>  The use of machine learning rapidly increases in high-risk scenarios where
decisions are required, for example in healthcare or industrial monitoring
equipment. In crucial situations, a model that can offer meaningful
explanations of its decision-making is essential. In industrial facilities, the
equipment's well-timed maintenance is vital to ensure continuous operation to
prevent money loss. Using machine learning, predictive and prescriptive
maintenance attempt to anticipate and prevent eventual system failures. This
paper introduces a visualisation tool incorporating interpretations to display
information derived from predictive maintenance models, trained on time-series
data.

    <title>Towards an AI Coach to Infer Team Mental Model Alignment in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Shared mental models are critical to team success; however, in practice, team
members may have misaligned models due to a variety of factors. In
safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation, healthcare), lack of shared mental
models can lead to preventable errors and harm. Towards the goal of mitigating
such preventable errors, here, we present a Bayesian approach to infer
misalignment in team members' mental models during complex healthcare task
execution. As an exemplary application, we demonstrate our approach using two
simulated team-based scenarios, derived from actual teamwork in cardiac
surgery. In these simulated experiments, our approach inferred model
misalignment with over 75% recall, thereby providing a building block for
enabling computer-assisted interventions to augment human cognition in the
operating room and improve teamwork.

    <title>A Generative Adversarial Network-based Selective Ensemble
  Characteristic-to-Expression Synthesis (SE-CTES) Approach and Its
  Applications in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Investigating the causal relationships between characteristics and
expressions plays a critical role in healthcare analytics. Effective synthesis
for expressions using given characteristics can make great contributions to
health risk management and medical decision-making. For example, predicting the
resulting physiological symptoms on patients from given treatment
characteristics is helpful for the disease prevention and personalized
treatment strategy design. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
effectively synthesize the expressions based on given characteristics. However,
the mapping from characteristics to expressions is usually from a relatively
low dimension space to a high dimension space, but most of the existing methods
such as regression models could not effectively handle such mapping. Besides,
the relationship between characteristics and expressions may contain not only
deterministic patterns, but also stochastic patterns. To address these
challenges, this paper proposed a novel selective ensemble
characteristic-to-expression synthesis (SE-CTES) approach inspired by
generative adversarial network (GAN). The novelty of the proposed method can be
summarized into three aspects: (1) GAN-based architecture for deep neural
networks are incorporated to learn the relatively low dimensional mapping to
high dimensional mapping containing both deterministic and stochastic patterns;
(2) the weights of the two mismatching errors in the GAN-based architecture are
proposed to be different to reduce the learning bias in the training process;
and (3) a selective ensemble learning framework is proposed to reduce the
prediction bias and improve the synthesis stability. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive numerical simulation studies
and a real-world healthcare case study were applied and the results
demonstrated that the proposed method is very promising.

    <title>Deep learning with noisy labels in medical prediction problems: a
  scoping review</title>
    <summary>  Objectives: Medical research faces substantial challenges from noisy labels
attributed to factors like inter-expert variability and machine-extracted
labels. Despite this, the adoption of label noise management remains limited,
and label noise is largely ignored. To this end, there is a critical need to
conduct a scoping review focusing on the problem space. This scoping review
aims to comprehensively review label noise management in deep learning-based
medical prediction problems, which includes label noise detection, label noise
handling, and evaluation. Research involving label uncertainty is also
included.
  Methods: Our scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched 4
databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar.
Our search terms include "noisy label AND medical / healthcare / clinical",
"un-certainty AND medical / healthcare / clinical", and "noise AND medical /
healthcare / clinical".
  Results: A total of 60 papers met inclusion criteria between 2016 and 2023. A
series of practical questions in medical research are investigated. These
include the sources of label noise, the impact of label noise, the detection of
label noise, label noise handling techniques, and their evaluation.
Categorization of both label noise detection methods and handling techniques
are provided.
  Discussion: From a methodological perspective, we observe that the medical
community has been up to date with the broader deep-learning community, given
that most techniques have been evaluated on medical data. We recommend
considering label noise as a standard element in medical research, even if it
is not dedicated to handling noisy labels. Initial experiments can start with
easy-to-implement methods, such as noise-robust loss functions, weighting, and
curriculum learning.

    <title>Audit to Forget: A Unified Method to Revoke Patients' Private Data in
  Intelligent Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Revoking personal private data is one of the basic human rights, which has
already been sheltered by several privacy-preserving laws in many countries.
However, with the development of data science, machine learning and deep
learning techniques, this right is usually neglected or violated as more and
more patients' data are being collected and used for model training, especially
in intelligent healthcare, thus making intelligent healthcare a sector where
technology must meet the law, regulations, and privacy principles to ensure
that the innovation is for the common good. In order to secure patients' right
to be forgotten, we proposed a novel solution by using auditing to guide the
forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been
used to train the model and forgetting requires the information of a query
dataset to be forgotten from the target model. We unified these two tasks by
introducing a new approach called knowledge purification. To implement our
solution, we developed AFS, a unified open-source software, which is able to
evaluate and revoke patients' private data from pre-trained deep learning
models. We demonstrated the generality of AFS by applying it to four tasks on
different datasets with various data sizes and architectures of deep learning
networks. The software is publicly available at

    <title>Learning to Predict with Supporting Evidence: Applications to Clinical
  Risk Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The impact of machine learning models on healthcare will depend on the degree
of trust that healthcare professionals place in the predictions made by these
models. In this paper, we present a method to provide people with clinical
expertise with domain-relevant evidence about why a prediction should be
trusted. We first design a probabilistic model that relates meaningful latent
concepts to prediction targets and observed data. Inference of latent variables
in this model corresponds to both making a prediction and providing supporting
evidence for that prediction. We present a two-step process to efficiently
approximate inference: (i) estimating model parameters using variational
learning, and (ii) approximating maximum a posteriori estimation of latent
variables in the model using a neural network, trained with an objective
derived from the probabilistic model. We demonstrate the method on the task of
predicting mortality risk for patients with cardiovascular disease.
Specifically, using electrocardiogram and tabular data as input, we show that
our approach provides appropriate domain-relevant supporting evidence for
accurate predictions.

    <title>Dental Severity Assessment through Few-shot Learning and SBERT
  Fine-tuning</title>
    <summary>  Dental diseases have a significant impact on a considerable portion of the
population, leading to various health issues that can detrimentally affect
individuals' overall well-being. The integration of automated systems in oral
healthcare has become increasingly crucial. Machine learning approaches offer a
viable solution to address challenges such as diagnostic difficulties,
inefficiencies, and errors in oral disease diagnosis. These methods prove
particularly useful when physicians struggle to predict or diagnose diseases at
their early stages. In this study, thirteen different machine learning, deep
learning, and large language models were employed to determine the severity
level of oral health issues based on radiologists' reports. The results
revealed that the Few-shot learning with SBERT and Multi-Layer Perceptron model
outperformed all other models across various experiments, achieving an
impressive accuracy of 94.1% as the best result. Consequently, this model
exhibits promise as a reliable tool for evaluating the severity of oral
diseases, enabling patients to receive more effective treatment and aiding
healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding resource
allocation and the management of high-risk patients.

    <title>ICDBigBird: A Contextual Embedding Model for ICD Code Classification</title>
    <summary>  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system is the
international standard for classifying diseases and procedures during a
healthcare encounter and is widely used for healthcare reporting and management
purposes. Assigning correct codes for clinical procedures is important for
clinical, operational, and financial decision-making in healthcare. Contextual
word embedding models have achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple NLP
tasks. However, these models have yet to achieve state-of-the-art results in
the ICD classification task since one of their main disadvantages is that they
can only process documents that contain a small number of tokens which is
rarely the case with real patient notes. In this paper, we introduce ICDBigBird
a BigBird-based model which can integrate a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN),
that takes advantage of the relations between ICD codes in order to create
'enriched' representations of their embeddings, with a BigBird contextual model
that can process larger documents. Our experiments on a real-world clinical
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our BigBird-based model on the ICD
classification task as it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.

    <title>Unleashing the Power of Electrocardiograms: A novel approach for Patient
  Identification in Healthcare Systems with ECG Signals</title>
    <summary>  Over the course of the past two decades, a substantial body of research has
substantiated the viability of utilising cardiac signals as a biometric
modality. This paper presents a novel approach for patient identification in
healthcare systems using electrocardiogram signals. A convolutional neural
network is used to classify users based on images extracted from ECG signals.
The proposed identification system is evaluated in multiple databases,
providing a comprehensive understanding of its potential in real-world
scenarios. The impact of Cardiovascular Diseases on generic user identification
has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The presented method takes
into account the cardiovascular condition of the patients, ensuring that the
results obtained are not biased or limited. Furthermore, the results obtained
are consistent and reliable, with lower error rates and higher accuracy
metrics, as demonstrated through extensive experimentation. All these features
make the proposed method a valuable contribution to the field of patient
identification in healthcare systems, and make it a strong contender for
practical applications.

    <title>A Review on Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare: Why,
  How, and When?</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly finding applications in
the field of medicine. Concerns have been raised about the explainability of
the decisions that are made by these AI models. In this article, we give a
systematic analysis of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with a
primary focus on models that are currently being used in the field of
healthcare. The literature search is conducted following the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards for
relevant work published from 1 January 2012 to 02 February 2022. The review
analyzes the prevailing trends in XAI and lays out the major directions in
which research is headed. We investigate the why, how, and when of the uses of
these XAI models and their implications. We present a comprehensive examination
of XAI methodologies as well as an explanation of how a trustworthy AI can be
derived from describing AI models for healthcare fields. The discussion of this
work will contribute to the formalization of the XAI field.

    <title>Heart Diseases Prediction Using Block-chain and Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Most people around the globe are dying due to heart disease. The main reason
behind the rapid increase in the death rate due to heart disease is that there
is no infrastructure developed for the healthcare department that can provide a
secure way of data storage and transmission. Due to redundancy in the patient
data, it is difficult for cardiac Professionals to predict the disease early
on. This rapid increase in the death rate due to heart disease can be
controlled by monitoring and eliminating some of the key attributes in the
early stages such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, body weight, and
addiction to smoking. Patient data can be monitored by cardiac Professionals
(Cp) by using the advanced framework in the healthcare departments. Blockchain
is the world's most reliable provider. The use of advanced systems in the
healthcare departments providing new ways of dealing with diseases has been
developed as well. In this article Machine Learning (ML) algorithm known as a
sine-cosine weighted k-nearest neighbor (SCA-WKNN) is used for predicting the
Hearth disease with the maximum accuracy among the existing approaches.
Blockchain technology has been used in the research to secure the data
throughout the session and can give more accurate results using this
technology. The performance of the system can be improved by using this
algorithm and the dataset proposed has been improved by using different
resources as well.

    <title>Effective and Interpretable fMRI Analysis via Functional Brain Network
  Generation</title>
    <summary>  Recent studies in neuroscience show great potential of functional brain
networks constructed from fMRI data for popularity modeling and clinical
predictions. However, existing functional brain networks are noisy and unaware
of downstream prediction tasks, while also incompatible with recent powerful
machine learning models of GNNs. In this work, we develop an end-to-end
trainable pipeline to extract prominent fMRI features, generate brain networks,
and make predictions with GNNs, all under the guidance of downstream prediction
tasks. Preliminary experiments on the PNC fMRI data show the superior
effectiveness and unique interpretability of our framework.

    <title>EHRFL: Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous EHRs and
  Precision-guided Selection of Participating Clients</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we provide solutions to two practical yet overlooked scenarios
in federated learning for electronic health records (EHRs): firstly, we
introduce EHRFL, a framework that facilitates federated learning across
healthcare institutions with distinct medical coding systems and database
schemas using text-based linearization of EHRs. Secondly, we focus on a
scenario where a single healthcare institution initiates federated learning to
build a model tailored for itself, in which the number of clients must be
optimized in order to reduce expenses incurred by the host. For selecting
participating clients, we present a novel precision-based method, leveraging
data latents to identify suitable participants for the institution. Our
empirical results show that EHRFL effectively enables federated learning across
hospitals with different EHR systems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the
efficacy of our precision-based method in selecting reduced number of
participating clients without compromising model performance, resulting in
lower operational costs when constructing institution-specific models. We
believe this work lays a foundation for the broader adoption of federated
learning on EHRs.

    <title>Using Under-trained Deep Ensembles to Learn Under Extreme Label Noise</title>
    <summary>  Improper or erroneous labelling can pose a hindrance to reliable
generalization for supervised learning. This can have negative consequences,
especially for critical fields such as healthcare. We propose an effective new
approach for learning under extreme label noise, based on under-trained deep
ensembles. Each ensemble member is trained with a subset of the training data,
to acquire a general overview of the decision boundary separation, without
focusing on potentially erroneous details. The accumulated knowledge of the
ensemble is combined to form new labels, that determine a better class
separation than the original labels. A new model is trained with these labels
to generalize reliably despite the label noise. We focus on a healthcare
setting and extensively evaluate our approach on the task of sleep apnea
detection. For comparison with related work, we additionally evaluate on the
task of digit recognition. In our experiments, we observed performance
improvement in accuracy from 6.7\% up-to 49.3\% for the task of digit
classification and in kappa from 0.02 up-to 0.55 for the task of sleep apnea
detection.

    <title>Leveraging Time Irreversibility with Order-Contrastive Pre-training</title>
    <summary>  Label-scarce, high-dimensional domains such as healthcare present a challenge
for modern machine learning techniques. To overcome the difficulties posed by a
lack of labeled data, we explore an "order-contrastive" method for
self-supervised pre-training on longitudinal data. We sample pairs of time
segments, switch the order for half of them, and train a model to predict
whether a given pair is in the correct order. Intuitively, the ordering task
allows the model to attend to the least time-reversible features (for example,
features that indicate progression of a chronic disease). The same features are
often useful for downstream tasks of interest. To quantify this, we study a
simple theoretical setting where we prove a finite-sample guarantee for the
downstream error of a representation learned with order-contrastive
pre-training. Empirically, in synthetic and longitudinal healthcare settings,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of order-contrastive pre-training in the
small-data regime over supervised learning and other self-supervised
pre-training baselines. Our results indicate that pre-training methods designed
for particular classes of distributions and downstream tasks can improve the
performance of self-supervised learning.

    <title>Predictive Modeling of ICU Healthcare-Associated Infections from
  Imbalanced Data. Using Ensembles and a Clustering-Based Undersampling
  Approach</title>
    <summary>  Early detection of patients vulnerable to infections acquired in the hospital
environment is a challenge in current health systems given the impact that such
infections have on patient mortality and healthcare costs. This work is focused
on both the identification of risk factors and the prediction of
healthcare-associated infections in intensive-care units by means of
machine-learning methods. The aim is to support decision making addressed at
reducing the incidence rate of infections. In this field, it is necessary to
deal with the problem of building reliable classifiers from imbalanced
datasets. We propose a clustering-based undersampling strategy to be used in
combination with ensemble classifiers. A comparative study with data from 4616
patients was conducted in order to validate our proposal. We applied several
single and ensemble classifiers both to the original dataset and to data
preprocessed by means of different resampling methods. The results were
analyzed by means of classic and recent metrics specifically designed for
imbalanced data classification. They revealed that the proposal is more
efficient in comparison with other approaches.

    <title>A Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Model for Imputation and Augmentation of
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Missing values exist in nearly all clinical studies because data for a
variable or question are not collected or not available. Inadequate handling of
missing values can lead to biased results and loss of statistical power in
analysis. Existing models usually do not consider privacy concerns or do not
utilise the inherent correlations across multiple features to impute the
missing values. In healthcare applications, we are usually confronted with high
dimensional and sometimes small sample size datasets that need more effective
augmentation or imputation techniques. Besides, imputation and augmentation
processes are traditionally conducted individually. However, imputing missing
values and augmenting data can significantly improve generalisation and avoid
bias in machine learning models. A Bayesian approach to impute missing values
and creating augmented samples in high dimensional healthcare data is proposed
in this work. We propose folded Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (F-HMC) with Bayesian
inference as a more practical approach to process the cross-dimensional
relations by applying a random walk and Hamiltonian dynamics to adapt posterior
distribution and generate large-scale samples. The proposed method is applied
to a cancer symptom assessment dataset and confirmed to enrich the quality of
data in precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, and propensity metric.

    <title>A Canonical Architecture For Predictive Analytics on Longitudinal
  Patient Records</title>
    <summary>  Many institutions within the healthcare ecosystem are making significant
investments in AI technologies to optimize their business operations at lower
cost with improved patient outcomes. Despite the hype with AI, the full
realization of this potential is seriously hindered by several systemic
problems, including data privacy, security, bias, fairness, and explainability.
In this paper, we propose a novel canonical architecture for the development of
AI models in healthcare that addresses these challenges. This system enables
the creation and management of AI predictive models throughout all the phases
of their life cycle, including data ingestion, model building, and model
promotion in production environments. This paper describes this architecture in
detail, along with a qualitative evaluation of our experience of using it on
real world problems.

    <title>Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series</title>
    <summary>  This study presents a novel approach to addressing the challenge of missing
data in multivariate time series, with a particular focus on the complexities
of healthcare data. Our Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) model,
grounded in a transformer-based framework, introduces a conditional hidden
state initialization tailored to the intricacies of medical time series data.
This methodology diverges from traditional imputation techniques by
specifically targeting the imbalance in missing data distribution, a crucial
aspect often overlooked in healthcare datasets. By integrating advanced
knowledge embedding and a non-uniform masking strategy, CSAI adeptly adjusts to
the distinct patterns of missing data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

    <title>A General-purpose AI Avatar in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Recent advancements in machine learning and natural language processing have
led to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) as a valuable tool
in the healthcare industry. Using large language models (LLMs) as
conversational agents or chatbots has the potential to assist doctors in
diagnosing patients, detecting early symptoms of diseases, and providing health
advice to patients. This paper focuses on the role of chatbots in healthcare
and explores the use of avatars to make AI interactions more appealing to
patients. A framework of a general-purpose AI avatar application is
demonstrated by using a three-category prompt dictionary and prompt improvement
mechanism. A two-phase approach is suggested to fine-tune a general-purpose AI
language model and create different AI avatars to discuss medical issues with
users. Prompt engineering enhances the chatbot's conversational abilities and
personality traits, fostering a more human-like interaction with patients.
Ultimately, the injection of personality into the chatbot could potentially
increase patient engagement. Future directions for research include
investigating ways to improve chatbots' understanding of context and ensuring
the accuracy of their outputs through fine-tuning with specialized medical data
sets.

    <title>Scaling Survival Analysis in Healthcare with Federated Survival Forests:
  A Comparative Study on Heart Failure and Breast Cancer Genomics</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis is a fundamental tool in medicine, modeling the time until
an event of interest occurs in a population. However, in real-world
applications, survival data are often incomplete, censored, distributed, and
confidential, especially in healthcare settings where privacy is critical. The
scarcity of data can severely limit the scalability of survival models to
distributed applications that rely on large data pools. Federated learning is a
promising technique that enables machine learning models to be trained on
multiple datasets without compromising user privacy, making it particularly
well-suited for addressing the challenges of survival data and large-scale
survival applications. Despite significant developments in federated learning
for classification and regression, many directions remain unexplored in the
context of survival analysis. In this work, we propose an extension of the
Federated Survival Forest algorithm, called FedSurF++. This federated ensemble
method constructs random survival forests in heterogeneous federations.
Specifically, we investigate several new tree sampling methods from client
forests and compare the results with state-of-the-art survival models based on
neural networks. The key advantage of FedSurF++ is its ability to achieve
comparable performance to existing methods while requiring only a single
communication round to complete. The extensive empirical investigation results
in a significant improvement from the algorithmic and privacy preservation
perspectives, making the original FedSurF algorithm more efficient, robust, and
private. We also present results on two real-world datasets demonstrating the
success of FedSurF++ in real-world healthcare studies. Our results underscore
the potential of FedSurF++ to improve the scalability and effectiveness of
survival analysis in distributed settings while preserving user privacy.

    <title>Equitable Allocation of Healthcare Resources with Fair Cox Models</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare programs such as Medicaid provide crucial services to vulnerable
populations, but due to limited resources, many of the individuals who need
these services the most languish on waiting lists. Survival models, e.g. the
Cox proportional hazards model, can potentially improve this situation by
predicting individuals' levels of need, which can then be used to prioritize
the waiting lists. Providing care to those in need can prevent
institutionalization for those individuals, which both improves quality of life
and reduces overall costs. While the benefits of such an approach are clear,
care must be taken to ensure that the prioritization process is fair or
independent of demographic information-based harmful stereotypes. In this work,
we develop multiple fairness definitions for survival models and corresponding
fair Cox proportional hazards models to ensure equitable allocation of
healthcare resources. We demonstrate the utility of our methods in terms of
fairness and predictive accuracy on two publicly available survival datasets.

    <title>Extending Process Discovery with Model Complexity Optimization and
  Cyclic States Identification: Application to Healthcare Processes</title>
    <summary>  Within Process mining, discovery techniques had made it possible to construct
business process models automatically from event logs. However, results often
do not achieve the balance between model complexity and its fitting accuracy,
so there is a need for manual model adjusting. The paper presents an approach
to process mining providing semi-automatic support to model optimization based
on the combined assessment of the model complexity and fitness. To balance
between the two ingredients, a model simplification approach is proposed, which
essentially abstracts the raw model at the desired granularity. Additionally,
we introduce a concept of meta-states, a cycle collapsing in the model, which
can potentially simplify the model and interpret it. We aim to demonstrate the
capabilities of the technological solution using three datasets from different
applications in the healthcare domain. They are remote monitoring process for
patients with arterial hypertension and workflows of healthcare workers during
the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study also investigates the use of various
complexity measures and different ways of solution application providing
insights on better practices in improving interpretability and
complexity/fitness balance in process models.

    <title>Redefining Digital Health Interfaces with Large Language Models</title>
    <summary>  Digital health tools have the potential to significantly improve the delivery
of healthcare services. However, their adoption remains comparatively limited
due, in part, to challenges surrounding usability and trust. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as general-purpose models with the ability to
process complex information and produce human-quality text, presenting a wealth
of potential applications in healthcare. Directly applying LLMs in clinical
settings is not straightforward, however, with LLMs susceptible to providing
inconsistent or nonsensical answers. We demonstrate how LLM-based systems can
utilize external tools and provide a novel interface between clinicians and
digital technologies. This enhances the utility and practical impact of digital
healthcare tools and AI models while addressing current issues with using LLMs
in clinical settings such as hallucinations. We illustrate LLM-based interfaces
with the example of cardiovascular disease risk prediction. We develop a new
prognostic tool using automated machine learning and demonstrate how LLMs can
provide a unique interface to both our model and existing risk scores,
highlighting the benefit compared to traditional interfaces for digital tools.

    <title>A novel Network Science Algorithm for Improving Triage of Patients</title>
    <summary>  Patient triage plays a crucial role in healthcare, ensuring timely and
appropriate care based on the urgency of patient conditions. Traditional triage
methods heavily rely on human judgment, which can be subjective and prone to
errors. Recently, a growing interest has been in leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) to develop algorithms for triaging patients. This paper
presents the development of a novel algorithm for triaging patients. It is
based on the analysis of patient data to produce decisions regarding their
prioritization. The algorithm was trained on a comprehensive data set
containing relevant patient information, such as vital signs, symptoms, and
medical history. The algorithm was designed to accurately classify patients
into triage categories through rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieved high accuracy and
performance, outperforming traditional triage methods. By incorporating
computer science into the triage process, healthcare professionals can benefit
from improved efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, prioritizing patients
effectively and optimizing resource allocation. Although further research is
needed to address challenges such as biases in training data and model
interpretability, the development of AI-based algorithms for triaging patients
shows great promise in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

    <title>Using Biological Variables and Social Determinants to Predict Malaria
  and Anemia among Children in Senegal</title>
    <summary>  Integrating machine learning techniques in healthcare becomes very common
nowadays, and it contributes positively to improving clinical care and health
decisions planning. Anemia and malaria are two life-threatening diseases in
Africa that affect the red blood cells and reduce hemoglobin production. This
paper focuses on analyzing child health data in Senegal using four machine
learning algorithms in Python: KNN, Random Forests, SVM, and Na\"ive Bayes. Our
task aims to investigate large-scale data from The Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) and to find out hidden information for anemia and malaria. We
present two classification models for the two blood disorders using biological
variables and social determinants. The findings of this research will
contribute to improving child healthcare in Senegal by eradicating anemia and
malaria, and decreasing the child mortality rate.

    <title>A Unified Framework for Human-Allied Learning of Probabilistic Circuits</title>
    <summary>  Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) have emerged as an efficient framework for
representing and learning complex probability distributions. Nevertheless, the
existing body of research on PCs predominantly concentrates on data-driven
parameter learning, often neglecting the potential of knowledge-intensive
learning, a particular issue in data-scarce/knowledge-rich domains such as
healthcare. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel unified framework that can
systematically integrate diverse domain knowledge into the parameter learning
process of PCs. Experiments on several benchmarks as well as real world
datasets show that our proposed framework can both effectively and efficiently
leverage domain knowledge to achieve superior performance compared to purely
data-driven learning approaches.

    <title>LogGENE: A smooth alternative to check loss for Deep Healthcare
  Inference Tasks</title>
    <summary>  Mining large datasets and obtaining calibrated predictions from tem is of
immediate relevance and utility in reliable deep learning. In our work, we
develop methods for Deep neural networks based inferences in such datasets like
the Gene Expression. However, unlike typical Deep learning methods, our
inferential technique, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of
accuracy, can also provide explanations, and report uncertainty estimates. We
adopt the Quantile Regression framework to predict full conditional quantiles
for a given set of housekeeping gene expressions. Conditional quantiles, in
addition to being useful in providing rich interpretations of the predictions,
are also robust to measurement noise. Our technique is particularly
consequential in High-throughput Genomics, an area which is ushering a new era
in personalized health care, and targeted drug design and delivery. However,
check loss, used in quantile regression to drive the estimation process is not
differentiable. We propose log-cosh as a smooth-alternative to the check loss.
We apply our methods on GEO microarray dataset. We also extend the method to
binary classification setting. Furthermore, we investigate other consequences
of the smoothness of the loss in faster convergence. We further apply the
classification framework to other healthcare inference tasks such as heart
disease, breast cancer, diabetes etc. As a test of generalization ability of
our framework, other non-healthcare related data sets for regression and
classification tasks are also evaluated.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning in Modern Biostatistics: Constructing Optimal
  Adaptive Interventions</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has acquired a prominent
position in health-related sequential decision-making problems, gaining
traction as a valuable tool for delivering adaptive interventions (AIs).
However, in part due to a poor synergy between the methodological and the
applied communities, its real-life application is still limited and its
potential is still to be realized. To address this gap, our work provides the
first unified technical survey on RL methods, complemented with case studies,
for constructing various types of AIs in healthcare. In particular, using the
common methodological umbrella of RL, we bridge two seemingly different AI
domains, dynamic treatment regimes and just-in-time adaptive interventions in
mobile health, highlighting similarities and differences between them and
discussing the implications of using RL. Open problems and considerations for
future research directions are outlined. Finally, we leverage our experience in
designing case studies in both areas to showcase the significant collaborative
opportunities between statistical, RL, and healthcare researchers in advancing
AIs.

    <title>No Pairs Left Behind: Improving Metric Learning with Regularized Triplet
  Objective</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel formulation of the triplet objective function that
improves metric learning without additional sample mining or overhead costs.
Our approach aims to explicitly regularize the distance between the positive
and negative samples in a triplet with respect to the anchor-negative distance.
As an initial validation, we show that our method (called No Pairs Left Behind
[NPLB]) improves upon the traditional and current state-of-the-art triplet
objective formulations on standard benchmark datasets. To show the
effectiveness and potentials of NPLB on real-world complex data, we evaluate
our approach on a large-scale healthcare dataset (UK Biobank), demonstrating
that the embeddings learned by our model significantly outperform all other
current representations on tested downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide a
new model-agnostic single-time health risk definition that, when used in tandem
with the learned representations, achieves the most accurate prediction of
subjects' future health complications. Our results indicate that NPLB is a
simple, yet effective framework for improving existing deep metric learning
models, showcasing the potential implications of metric learning in more
complex applications, especially in the biological and healthcare domains.

    <title>Adaptive Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Timely Healthcare
  Interventions</title>
    <summary>  Effective patient monitoring is vital for timely interventions and improved
healthcare outcomes. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to handle
complex, dynamic environments with fluctuating vital signs, leading to delays
in identifying critical conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel AI-driven patient monitoring framework using multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach deploys multiple learning agents,
each dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological feature, such as heart
rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic
healthcare monitoring environment, learn the patients' behaviour patterns, and
make informed decisions to alert the corresponding Medical Emergency Teams
(METs) based on the level of emergency estimated. In this study, we evaluate
the performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework using real-world
physiological and motion data from two datasets: PPG-DaLiA and WESAD. We
compare the results with several baseline models, including Q-Learning, PPO,
Actor-Critic, Double DQN, and DDPG, as well as monitoring frameworks like
WISEML and CA-MAQL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach
outperforms all other baseline models, achieving more accurate monitoring of
patient's vital signs. Furthermore, we conduct hyperparameter optimization to
fine-tune the learning process of each agent. By optimizing hyperparameters, we
enhance the learning rate and discount factor, thereby improving the agents'
overall performance in monitoring patient health status.

    <title>Explainable Deep Learning in Healthcare: A Methodological Survey from an
  Attribution View</title>
    <summary>  The increasing availability of large collections of electronic health record
(EHR) data and unprecedented technical advances in deep learning (DL) have
sparked a surge of research interest in developing DL based clinical decision
support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Despite the
recognition of the value of deep learning in healthcare, impediments to further
adoption in real healthcare settings remain due to the black-box nature of DL.
Therefore, there is an emerging need for interpretable DL, which allows end
users to evaluate the model decision making to know whether to accept or reject
predictions and recommendations before an action is taken. In this review, we
focus on the interpretability of the DL models in healthcare. We start by
introducing the methods for interpretability in depth and comprehensively as a
methodological reference for future researchers or clinical practitioners in
this field. Besides the methods' details, we also include a discussion of
advantages and disadvantages of these methods and which scenarios each of them
is suitable for, so that interested readers can know how to compare and choose
among them for use. Moreover, we discuss how these methods, originally
developed for solving general-domain problems, have been adapted and applied to
healthcare problems and how they can help physicians better understand these
data-driven technologies. Overall, we hope this survey can help researchers and
practitioners in both artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical fields
understand what methods we have for enhancing the interpretability of their DL
models and choose the optimal one accordingly.

    <title>Explaining a machine learning decision to physicians via counterfactuals</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models perform well on several healthcare tasks and can help
reduce the burden on the healthcare system. However, the lack of explainability
is a major roadblock to their adoption in hospitals. \textit{How can the
decision of an ML model be explained to a physician?} The explanations
considered in this paper are counterfactuals (CFs), hypothetical scenarios that
would have resulted in the opposite outcome. Specifically, time-series CFs are
investigated, inspired by the way physicians converse and reason out decisions
`I would have given the patient a vasopressor if their blood pressure was lower
and falling'. Key properties of CFs that are particularly meaningful in
clinical settings are outlined: physiological plausibility, relevance to the
task and sparse perturbations. Past work on CF generation does not satisfy
these properties, specifically plausibility in that realistic time-series CFs
are not generated. A variational autoencoder (VAE)-based approach is proposed
that captures these desired properties. The method produces CFs that improve on
prior approaches quantitatively (more plausible CFs as evaluated by their
likelihood w.r.t original data distribution, and 100$\times$ faster at
generating CFs) and qualitatively (2$\times$ more plausible and relevant) as
evaluated by three physicians.

    <title>Interpretable Prediction and Feature Selection for Survival Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis is widely used as a technique to model time-to-event data
when some data is censored, particularly in healthcare for predicting future
patient risk. In such settings, survival models must be both accurate and
interpretable so that users (such as doctors) can trust the model and
understand model predictions. While most literature focuses on discrimination,
interpretability is equally as important. A successful interpretable model
should be able to describe how changing each feature impacts the outcome, and
should only use a small number of features. In this paper, we present DyS
(pronounced ``dice''), a new survival analysis model that achieves both strong
discrimination and interpretability. DyS is a feature-sparse Generalized
Additive Model, combining feature selection and interpretable prediction into
one model. While DyS works well for all survival analysis problems, it is
particularly useful for large (in $n$ and $p$) survival datasets such as those
commonly found in observational healthcare studies. Empirical studies show that
DyS competes with other state-of-the-art machine learning models for survival
analysis, while being highly interpretable.

    <title>Estimation of causal effects of multiple treatments in healthcare
  database studies with rare outcomes</title>
    <summary>  The preponderance of large-scale healthcare databases provide abundant
opportunities for comparative effectiveness research. Evidence necessary to
making informed treatment decisions often relies on comparing effectiveness of
multiple treatment options on outcomes of interest observed in a small number
of individuals. Causal inference with multiple treatments and rare outcomes is
a subject that has been treated sparingly in the literature. This paper designs
three sets of simulations, representative of the structure of our healthcare
database study, and propose causal analysis strategies for such settings. We
investigate and compare the operating characteristics of three types of methods
and their variants: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), regression
adjustment on multivariate spline of generalized propensity scores (RAMS) and
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) with multinomial logistic
regression or generalized boosted models. Our results suggest that BART and
RAMS provide lower bias and mean squared error, and the widely used IPTW
methods deliver unfavorable operating characteristics. We illustrate the
methods using a case study evaluating the comparative effectiveness of
robotic-assisted surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and open
thoracotomy for treating non-small cell lung cancer.

    <title>MentalBERT: Publicly Available Pretrained Language Models for Mental
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Mental health is a critical issue in modern society, and mental disorders
could sometimes turn to suicidal ideation without adequate treatment. Early
detection of mental disorders and suicidal ideation from social content
provides a potential way for effective social intervention. Recent advances in
pretrained contextualized language representations have promoted the
development of several domain-specific pretrained models and facilitated
several downstream applications. However, there are no existing pretrained
language models for mental healthcare. This paper trains and release two
pretrained masked language models, i.e., MentalBERT and MentalRoBERTa, to
benefit machine learning for the mental healthcare research community. Besides,
we evaluate our trained domain-specific models and several variants of
pretrained language models on several mental disorder detection benchmarks and
demonstrate that language representations pretrained in the target domain
improve the performance of mental health detection tasks.

    <title>Temporal Causal Mediation through a Point Process: Direct and Indirect
  Effects of Healthcare Interventions</title>
    <summary>  Deciding on an appropriate intervention requires a causal model of a
treatment, the outcome, and potential mediators. Causal mediation analysis lets
us distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the intervention, but has
mostly been studied in a static setting. In healthcare, data come in the form
of complex, irregularly sampled time-series, with dynamic interdependencies
between a treatment, outcomes, and mediators across time. Existing approaches
to dynamic causal mediation analysis are limited to regular measurement
intervals, simple parametric models, and disregard long-range mediator--outcome
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a non-parametric
mediator--outcome model where the mediator is assumed to be a temporal point
process that interacts with the outcome process. With this model, we estimate
the direct and indirect effects of an external intervention on the outcome,
showing how each of these affects the whole future trajectory. We demonstrate
on semi-synthetic data that our method can accurately estimate direct and
indirect effects. On real-world healthcare data, our model infers clinically
meaningful direct and indirect effect trajectories for blood glucose after a
surgery.

    <title>Transformer-based classification of user queries for medical consultancy
  with respect to expert specialization</title>
    <summary>  The need for skilled medical support is growing in the era of digital
healthcare. This research presents an innovative strategy, utilizing the RuBERT
model, for categorizing user inquiries in the field of medical consultation
with a focus on expert specialization. By harnessing the capabilities of
transformers, we fine-tuned the pre-trained RuBERT model on a varied dataset,
which facilitates precise correspondence between queries and particular medical
specialisms. Using a comprehensive dataset, we have demonstrated our approach's
superior performance with an F1-score of over 92%, calculated through both
cross-validation and the traditional split of test and train datasets. Our
approach has shown excellent generalization across medical domains such as
cardiology, neurology and dermatology. This methodology provides practical
benefits by directing users to appropriate specialists for prompt and targeted
medical advice. It also enhances healthcare system efficiency, reduces
practitioner burden, and improves patient care quality. In summary, our
suggested strategy facilitates the attainment of specific medical knowledge,
offering prompt and precise advice within the digital healthcare field.

    <title>Evaluating Embeddings for One-Shot Classification of Doctor-AI
  Consultations</title>
    <summary>  Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial
to providing high-quality patient care. In this work, we investigate how
Doctor-written and AI-generated texts in healthcare consultations can be
classified using state-of-the-art embeddings and one-shot classification
systems. By analyzing embeddings such as bag-of-words, character n-grams,
Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText, and GPT2 embeddings, we examine how well our
one-shot classification systems capture semantic information within medical
consultations. Results show that the embeddings are capable of capturing
semantic features from text in a reliable and adaptable manner. Overall,
Word2Vec, GloVe and Character n-grams embeddings performed well, indicating
their suitability for modeling targeted to this task. GPT2 embedding also shows
notable performance, indicating its suitability for models tailored to this
task as well. Our machine learning architectures significantly improved the
quality of health conversations when training data are scarce, improving
communication between patients and healthcare providers.

    <title>Enhancement of Healthcare Data Transmission using the
  Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  In the healthcare system, patients are required to use wearable devices for
the remote data collection and real-time monitoring of health data and the
status of health conditions. This adoption of wearables results in a
significant increase in the volume of data that is collected and transmitted.
As the devices are run by small battery power, they can be quickly diminished
due to the high processing requirements of the device for data collection and
transmission. Given the importance attached to medical data, it is imperative
that all transmitted data adhere to strict integrity and availability
requirements. Reducing the volume of healthcare data and the frequency of
transmission will improve the device battery life via using inference
algorithm. There is an issue of improving transmission metrics with accuracy
and efficiency, which trade-off each other such as increasing accuracy reduces
the efficiency. This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to
analyze complex health data metrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data
transmission to overcome the trade-off problem using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm to enhance both metrics by taking fewer samples to transmit whilst
maintaining the accuracy. The algorithm is tested with a standard heart rate
dataset to compare the metrics. The result shows that the LMA has best
performed with an efficiency of 3.33 times for reduced sample data size and
accuracy of 79.17%, which has the similar accuracies in 7 different sampling
cases adopted for testing but demonstrates improved efficiency. These proposed
methods significantly improved both metrics using machine learning without
sacrificing a metric over the other compared to the existing methods with high
efficiency.

    <title>Large Language Models Struggle in Token-Level Clinical Named Entity
  Recognition</title>
    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various sectors, including
healthcare where they are employed in diverse applications. Their utility is
particularly significant in the context of rare diseases, where data scarcity,
complexity, and specificity pose considerable challenges. In the clinical
domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) stands out as an essential task and it
plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from clinical texts.
Despite the promise of LLMs, current research mostly concentrates on
document-level NER, identifying entities in a more general context across
entire documents, without extracting their precise location. Additionally,
efforts have been directed towards adapting ChatGPT for token-level NER.
However, there is a significant research gap when it comes to employing
token-level NER for clinical texts, especially with the use of local
open-source LLMs. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the
effectiveness of both proprietary and local LLMs in token-level clinical NER.
Essentially, we delve into the capabilities of these models through a series of
experiments involving zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction-fine-tuning. Our
exploration reveals the inherent challenges LLMs face in token-level NER,
particularly in the context of rare diseases, and suggests possible
improvements for their application in healthcare. This research contributes to
narrowing a significant gap in healthcare informatics and offers insights that
could lead to a more refined application of LLMs in the healthcare sector.

    <title>Sample-Specific Debiasing for Better Image-Text Models</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised representation learning on image-text data facilitates
crucial medical applications, such as image classification, visual grounding,
and cross-modal retrieval. One common approach involves contrasting
semantically similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data points.
Drawing negative samples uniformly from the training data set introduces false
negatives, i.e., samples that are treated as dissimilar but belong to the same
class. In healthcare data, the underlying class distribution is nonuniform,
implying that false negatives occur at a highly variable rate. To improve the
quality of learned representations, we develop a novel approach that corrects
for false negatives. Our method can be viewed as a variant of debiased
contrastive learning that uses estimated sample-specific class probabilities.
We provide theoretical analysis of the objective function and demonstrate the
proposed approach on both image and paired image-text data sets. Our
experiments illustrate empirical advantages of sample-specific debiasing.

    <title>Clinical Predictive Models for COVID-19: Systematic Study</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due
to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems
are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of
SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical
ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on
healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we
study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and
based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to
receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care.
To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a
retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of
5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models
identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a
sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%,
51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92
AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require
critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine
which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the
aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models
trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical
pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.

healthcare system. In the United States alone, treatment of readmitted diabetic
patients exceeds 250 million dollars per year. Early identification of patients
facing a high risk of readmission can enable healthcare providers to to conduct
additional investigations and possibly prevent future readmissions. This not
only improves the quality of care but also reduces the medical expenses on
readmission. Machine learning methods have been leveraged on public health data
to build a system for identifying diabetic patients facing a high risk of
future readmission. Number of inpatient visits, discharge disposition and
admission type were identified as strong predictors of readmission. Further, it
was found that the number of laboratory tests and discharge disposition
together predict whether the patient will be readmitted shortly after being
discharged from the hospital (i.e. &lt;30 days) or after a longer period of time
(i.e. &gt;30 days). These insights can help healthcare providers to improve
inpatient diabetic care. Finally, the cost analysis suggests that \$252.76
million can be saved across 98,053 diabetic patient encounters by incorporating
the proposed cost sensitive analysis model.

    <title>Beyond Patient Monitoring: Conversational Agents Role in Telemedicine &amp;
  Healthcare Support For Home-Living Elderly Individuals</title>
    <summary>  There is a need for systems to dynamically interact with ageing populations
to gather information, monitor health condition and provide support, especially
after hospital discharge or at-home settings. Several smart devices have been
delivered by digital health, bundled with telemedicine systems, smartphone and
other digital services. While such solutions offer personalised data and
suggestions, the real disruptive step comes from the interaction of new digital
ecosystem, represented by chatbots. Chatbots will play a leading role by
embodying the function of a virtual assistant and bridging the gap between
patients and clinicians. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms,
chatbots are forecasted to save healthcare costs when used in place of a human
or assist them as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and
providing self-care recommendations. This paper describes integrating chatbots
into telemedicine systems intended for elderly patient after their hospital
discharge. The paper discusses possible ways to utilise chatbots to assist
healthcare providers and support patients with their condition.

    <title>Impact of Inference Accelerators on hardware selection</title>
    <summary>  As opportunities for AI-assisted healthcare grow steadily, model deployment
faces challenges due to the specific characteristics of the industry. The
configuration choice for a production device can impact model performance while
influencing operational costs. Moreover, in healthcare some situations might
require fast, but not real time, inference. We study different configurations
and conduct a cost-performance analysis to determine the optimized hardware for
the deployment of a model subject to healthcare domain constraints. We observe
that a naive performance comparison may not lead to an optimal configuration
selection. In fact, given realistic domain constraints, CPU execution might be
preferable to GPU accelerators. Hence, defining beforehand precise expectations
for model deployment is crucial.

    <title>Real-World Multi-Domain Data Applications for Generalizations to
  Clinical Settings</title>
    <summary>  With promising results of machine learning based models in computer vision,
applications on medical imaging data have been increasing exponentially.
However, generalizations to complex real-world clinical data is a persistent
problem. Deep learning models perform well when trained on standardized
datasets from artificial settings, such as clinical trials. However, real-world
data is different and translations are yielding varying results. The complexity
of real-world applications in healthcare could emanate from a mixture of
different data distributions across multiple device domains alongside the
inevitable noise sourced from varying image resolutions, human errors, and the
lack of manual gradings. In addition, healthcare applications not only suffer
from the scarcity of labeled data, but also face limited access to unlabeled
data due to HIPAA regulations, patient privacy, ambiguity in data ownership,
and challenges in collecting data from different sources. These limitations
pose additional challenges to applying deep learning algorithms in healthcare
and clinical translations. In this paper, we utilize self-supervised
representation learning methods, formulated effectively in transfer learning
settings, to address limited data availability. Our experiments verify the
importance of diverse real-world data for generalization to clinical settings.
We show that by employing a self-supervised approach with transfer learning on
a multi-domain real-world dataset, we can achieve 16% relative improvement on a
standardized dataset over supervised baselines.

    <title>Label Propagation for Learning with Label Proportions</title>
    <summary>  Learning with Label Proportions (LLP) is the problem of recovering the
underlying true labels given a dataset when the data is presented in the form
of bags. This paradigm is particularly suitable in contexts where providing
individual labels is expensive and label aggregates are more easily obtained.
In the healthcare domain, it is a burden for a patient to keep a detailed diary
of their daily routines, but often they will be amenable to provide higher
level summaries of daily behavior. We present a novel and efficient graph-based
algorithm that encourages local smoothness and exploits the global structure of
the data, while preserving the `mass' of each bag.

    <title>Speech Emotion Recognition Using CNN and Its Use Case in Digital
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The process of identifying human emotion and affective states from speech is
known as speech emotion recognition (SER). This is based on the observation
that tone and pitch in the voice frequently convey underlying emotion. Speech
recognition includes the ability to recognize emotions, which is becoming
increasingly popular and in high demand. With the help of appropriate factors
(such modalities, emotions, intensities, repetitions, etc.) found in the data,
my research seeks to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish
emotions from audio recordings and label them in accordance with the range of
different emotions. I have developed a machine learning model to identify
emotions from supplied audio files with the aid of machine learning methods.
The evaluation is mostly focused on precision, recall, and F1 score, which are
common machine learning metrics. To properly set up and train the machine
learning framework, the main objective is to investigate the influence and
cross-relation of all input and output parameters. To improve the ability to
recognize intentions, a key condition for communication, I have evaluated
emotions using my specialized machine learning algorithm via voice that would
address the emotional state from voice with the help of digital healthcare,
bridging the gap between human and artificial intelligence (AI).

    <title>Fairness-Aware Interpretable Modeling (FAIM) for Trustworthy Machine
  Learning in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The escalating integration of machine learning in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare raises substantial concerns about model fairness. We propose an
interpretable framework - Fairness-Aware Interpretable Modeling (FAIM), to
improve model fairness without compromising performance, featuring an
interactive interface to identify a "fairer" model from a set of
high-performing models and promoting the integration of data-driven evidence
and clinical expertise to enhance contextualized fairness. We demonstrated
FAIM's value in reducing sex and race biases by predicting hospital admission
with two real-world databases, MIMIC-IV-ED and SGH-ED. We show that for both
datasets, FAIM models not only exhibited satisfactory discriminatory
performance but also significantly mitigated biases as measured by
well-established fairness metrics, outperforming commonly used bias-mitigation
methods. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of improving fairness
without sacrificing performance and provides an a modeling mode that invites
domain experts to engage, fostering a multidisciplinary effort toward tailored
AI fairness.

    <title>Self-Attention Enhanced Patient Journey Understanding in Healthcare
  System</title>
    <summary>  Understanding patients' journeys in healthcare system is a fundamental
prepositive task for a broad range of AI-based healthcare applications. This
task aims to learn an informative representation that can comprehensively
encode hidden dependencies among medical events and its inner entities, and
then the use of encoding outputs can greatly benefit the downstream
application-driven tasks. A patient journey is a sequence of electronic health
records (EHRs) over time that is organized at multiple levels: patient, visits
and medical codes. The key challenge of patient journey understanding is to
design an effective encoding mechanism which can properly tackle the
aforementioned multi-level structured patient journey data with temporal
sequential visits and a set of medical codes. This paper proposes a novel
self-attention mechanism that can simultaneously capture the contextual and
temporal relationships hidden in patient journeys. A multi-level self-attention
network (MusaNet) is specifically designed to learn the representations of
patient journeys that is used to be a long sequence of activities. The MusaNet
is trained in end-to-end manner using the training data derived from EHRs. We
evaluated the efficacy of our method on two medical application tasks with
real-world benchmark datasets. The results have demonstrated the proposed
MusaNet produces higher-quality representations than state-of-the-art baseline
methods. The source code is available in https://github.com/xueping/MusaNet.

    <title>GeoECG: Data Augmentation via Wasserstein Geodesic Perturbation for
  Robust Electrocardiogram Prediction</title>
    <summary>  There has been an increased interest in applying deep neural networks to
automatically interpret and analyze the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The
current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount
of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for
clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and
costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required.
Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples
and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example,
when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance
claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation
method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease
detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the
data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein
space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric
that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically
determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to
distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate
improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our
data augmentation method.

    <title>Demystifying Quantum Blockchain for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The application of blockchain technology can be beneficial in the field of
healthcare as well as in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. In this work,
the importance of blockchain is analyzed and it is observed that blockchain
technology and the processes associated with it will be utilised in the
healthcare systems of the future for data acquisition from sensors, automatic
patient monitoring, and secure data storage. This technology substantially
simplifies the process of carrying out operations because it can store a
substantial quantity of data in a dispersed and secure manner, as well as
enable access whenever and wherever it is required to do so. With the
assistance of quantum blockchain, the benefits of quantum computing, such as
the capability to acquire thermal imaging based on quantum computing and the
speed with which patients may be located and monitored, can all be exploited to
their full potential. Quantum blockchain is another tool that can be utilised
to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, and accessibility of data
records. The processing of medical records could potentially benefit from
greater speed and privacy if it combines quantum computing and blockchain
technology. The authors of this paper investigate the possible benefits and
applications of blockchain and quantum technologies in the field of medicine,
pharmacy and healthcare systems. In this context, this work explored and
compared quantum technologies and blockchain-based technologies in conjunction
with other cutting-edge information and communications technologies such as
ratification intelligence, machine learning, drones, and so on.

    <title>Global Differential Privacy for Distributed Metaverse Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  Metaverse-enabled digital healthcare systems are expected to exploit an
unprecedented amount of personal health data, while ensuring that sensitive or
private information of individuals are not disclosed. Machine learning and
artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques can be widely utilized in metaverse
healthcare systems, such as virtual clinics and intelligent consultations. In
such scenarios, the key challenge is that data privacy laws might not allow
virtual clinics to share their medical data with other parties. Moreover,
clinical AI/ML models themselves carry extensive information about the medical
datasets, such that private attributes can be easily inferred by malicious
actors in the metaverse (if not rigorously privatized). In this paper, inspired
by the idea of "incognito mode", which has recently been developed as a
promising solution to safeguard metaverse users' privacy, we propose global
differential privacy for the distributed metaverse healthcare systems. In our
scheme, a randomized mechanism in the format of artificial "mix-up" noise is
applied to the federated clinical ML/AI models before sharing with other peers.
This way, we provide an adjustable level of distributed privacy against both
the malicious actors and honest-but curious metaverse servers. Our evaluations
on breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (BCWD) highlight the privacy-utility
trade-off (PUT) in terms of diagnosis accuracy and loss function for different
levels of privacy. We also compare our private scheme with the non-private
centralized setup in terms of diagnosis accuracy.

    <title>Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition for Smart Hospitals using
  Low-Resolution Depth Images</title>
    <summary>  Computer-vision hospital systems can greatly assist healthcare workers and
improve medical facility treatment, but often face patient resistance due to
the perceived intrusiveness and violation of privacy associated with visual
surveillance. We downsample video frames to extremely low resolutions to
degrade private information from surveillance videos. We measure the amount of
activity-recognition information retained in low resolution depth images, and
also apply a privately-trained DCSCN super-resolution model to enhance the
utility of our images. We implement our techniques with two actual
healthcare-surveillance scenarios, hand-hygiene compliance and ICU
activity-logging, and show that our privacy-preserving techniques preserve
enough information for realistic healthcare tasks.

    <title>Epidemic Control Modeling using Parsimonious Models and Markov Decision
  Processes</title>
    <summary>  Many countries have experienced at least two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The second wave is far more dangerous as distinct strains appear more harmful
to human health, but it stems from the complacency about the first wave. This
paper introduces a parsimonious yet representative stochastic epidemic model
that simulates the uncertain spread of the disease regardless of the latency
and recovery time distributions. We also propose a Markov decision process to
seek an optimal trade-off between the usage of the healthcare system and the
economic costs of an epidemic. We apply the model to COVID-19 data from New
Delhi, India and simulate the epidemic spread with different policy review
times. The results show that the optimal policy acts swiftly to curb the
epidemic in the first wave, thus avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system
and the future costs of posterior outbreaks. An analysis of the recent collapse
of the healthcare system of India during the second COVID-19 wave suggests that
many lives could have been preserved if swift mitigation was promoted after the
first wave.

    <title>Mapping Unparalleled Clinical Professional and Consumer Languages with
  Embedding Alignment</title>
    <summary>  Mapping and translating professional but arcane clinical jargons to consumer
language is essential to improve the patient-clinician communication.
Researchers have used the existing biomedical ontologies and consumer health
vocabulary dictionary to translate between the languages. However, such
approaches are limited by expert efforts to manually build the dictionary,
which is hard to be generalized and scalable. In this work, we utilized the
embeddings alignment method for the word mapping between unparalleled clinical
professional and consumer language embeddings. To map semantically similar
words in two different word embeddings, we first independently trained word
embeddings on both the corpus with abundant clinical professional terms and the
other with mainly healthcare consumer terms. Then, we aligned the embeddings by
the Procrustes algorithm. We also investigated the approach with the
adversarial training with refinement. We evaluated the quality of the alignment
through the similar words retrieval both by computing the model precision and
as well as judging qualitatively by human. We show that the Procrustes
algorithm can be performant for the professional consumer language embeddings
alignment, whereas adversarial training with refinement may find some relations
between two languages.

    <title>A Machine Learning Based Framework for the Smart Healthcare Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the smart healthcare system,
where we employ the compressed sensing (CS) and the combination of the
state-of-the-art machine learning based denoiser as well as the alternating
direction of method of multipliers (ADMM) structure. This integration
significantly simplifies the software implementation for the lowcomplexity
encoder, thanks to the modular structure of ADMM. Furthermore, we focus on
detecting fall down actions from image streams. Thus, teh primary purpose of
thus study is to reconstruct the image as visibly clear as possible and hence
it helps the detection step at the trained classifier. For this efficient smart
health monitoring framework, we employ the trained binary convolutional neural
network (CNN) classifier for the fall-action classifier, because this scheme is
a part of surveillance scenario. In this scenario, we deal with the fallimages,
thus, we compress, transmit and reconstruct the fallimages. Experimental
results demonstrate the impacts of network parameters and the significant
performance gain of the proposal compared to traditional methods.

    <title>FADL:Federated-Autonomous Deep Learning for Distributed Electronic
  Health Record</title>
    <summary>  Electronic health record (EHR) data is collected by individual institutions
and often stored across locations in silos. Getting access to these data is
difficult and slow due to security, privacy, regulatory, and operational
issues. We show, using ICU data from 58 different hospitals, that machine
learning models to predict patient mortality can be trained efficiently without
moving health data out of their silos using a distributed machine learning
strategy. We propose a new method, called Federated-Autonomous Deep Learning
(FADL) that trains part of the model using all data sources in a distributed
manner and other parts using data from specific data sources. We observed that
FADL outperforms traditional federated learning strategy and conclude that
balance between global and local training is an important factor to consider
when design distributed machine learning methods , especially in healthcare.

    <title>Two-stage Federated Phenotyping and Patient Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  A large percentage of medical information is in unstructured text format in
electronic medical record systems. Manual extraction of information from
clinical notes is extremely time consuming. Natural language processing has
been widely used in recent years for automatic information extraction from
medical texts. However, algorithms trained on data from a single healthcare
provider are not generalizable and error-prone due to the heterogeneity and
uniqueness of medical documents. We develop a two-stage federated natural
language processing method that enables utilization of clinical notes from
different hospitals or clinics without moving the data, and demonstrate its
performance using obesity and comorbities phenotyping as medical task. This
approach not only improves the quality of a specific clinical task but also
facilitates knowledge progression in the whole healthcare system, which is an
essential part of learning health system. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of federated machine learning in clinical NLP.

    <title>NCoRE: Neural Counterfactual Representation Learning for Combinations of
  Treatments</title>
    <summary>  Estimating an individual's potential response to interventions from
observational data is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as
healthcare, public policy or economics. In this setting, it is often the case
that combinations of interventions may be applied simultaneously, for example,
multiple prescriptions in healthcare or different fiscal and monetary measures
in economics. However, existing methods for counterfactual inference are
limited to settings in which actions are not used simultaneously. Here, we
present Neural Counterfactual Relation Estimation (NCoRE), a new method for
learning counterfactual representations in the combination treatment setting
that explicitly models cross-treatment interactions. NCoRE is based on a novel
branched conditional neural representation that includes learnt treatment
interaction modulators to infer the potential causal generative process
underlying the combination of multiple treatments. Our experiments show that
NCoRE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for
counterfactual treatment effect estimation that do not account for the effects
of combining multiple treatments across several synthetic, semi-synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

    <title>Recent Advances in Predictive Modeling with Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  The development of electronic health records (EHR) systems has enabled the
collection of a vast amount of digitized patient data. However, utilizing EHR
data for predictive modeling presents several challenges due to its unique
characteristics. With the advancements in machine learning techniques, deep
learning has demonstrated its superiority in various applications, including
healthcare. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in deep
learning-based predictive models using EHR data. Specifically, we begin by
introducing the background of EHR data and providing a mathematical definition
of the predictive modeling task. We then categorize and summarize predictive
deep models from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we present benchmarks and
toolkits relevant to predictive modeling in healthcare. Finally, we conclude
this survey by discussing open challenges and suggesting promising directions
for future research.

    <title>On the Performance of Imputation Techniques for Missing Values on
  Healthcare Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Missing values or data is one popular characteristic of real-world datasets,
especially healthcare data. This could be frustrating when using machine
learning algorithms on such datasets, simply because most machine learning
models perform poorly in the presence of missing values. The aim of this study
is to compare the performance of seven imputation techniques, namely Mean
imputation, Median Imputation, Last Observation carried Forward (LOCF)
imputation, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation, Interpolation imputation,
Missforest imputation, and Multiple imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), on
three healthcare datasets. Some percentage of missing values - 10\%, 15\%, 20\%
and 25\% - were introduced into the dataset, and the imputation techniques were
employed to impute these missing values. The comparison of their performance
was evaluated by using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error
(MAE). The results show that Missforest imputation performs the best followed
by MICE imputation. Additionally, we try to determine whether it is better to
perform feature selection before imputation or vice versa by using the
following metrics - the recall, precision, f1-score and accuracy. Due to the
fact that there are few literature on this and some debate on the subject among
researchers, we hope that the results from this experiment will encourage data
scientists and researchers to perform imputation first before feature selection
when dealing with data containing missing values.

    <title>From Bit To Bedside: A Practical Framework For Artificial Intelligence
  Product Development In Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare holds great potential to expand
access to high-quality medical care, whilst reducing overall systemic costs.
Despite hitting the headlines regularly and many publications of
proofs-of-concept, certified products are failing to breakthrough to the
clinic. AI in healthcare is a multi-party process with deep knowledge required
in multiple individual domains. The lack of understanding of the specific
challenges in the domain is, therefore, the major contributor to the failure to
deliver on the big promises. Thus, we present a decision perspective framework,
for the development of AI-driven biomedical products, from conception to market
launch. Our framework highlights the risks, objectives and key results which
are typically required to proceed through a three-phase process to the market
launch of a validated medical AI product. We focus on issues related to
Clinical validation, Regulatory affairs, Data strategy and Algorithmic
development. The development process we propose for AI in healthcare software
strongly diverges from modern consumer software development processes. We
highlight the key time points to guide founders, investors and key stakeholders
throughout their relevant part of the process. Our framework should be seen as
a template for innovation frameworks, which can be used to coordinate team
communications and responsibilities towards a reasonable product development
roadmap, thus unlocking the potential of AI in medicine.

    <title>Evaluating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Observational Health
  Settings</title>
    <summary>  Much attention has been devoted recently to the development of machine
learning algorithms with the goal of improving treatment policies in
healthcare. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-field within machine learning
that is concerned with learning how to make sequences of decisions so as to
optimize long-term effects. Already, RL algorithms have been proposed to
identify decision-making strategies for mechanical ventilation, sepsis
management and treatment of schizophrenia. However, before implementing
treatment policies learned by black-box algorithms in high-stakes clinical
decision problems, special care must be taken in the evaluation of these
policies.
  In this document, our goal is to expose some of the subtleties associated
with evaluating RL algorithms in healthcare. We aim to provide a conceptual
starting point for clinical and computational researchers to ask the right
questions when designing and evaluating algorithms for new ways of treating
patients. In the following, we describe how choices about how to summarize a
history, variance of statistical estimators, and confounders in more ad-hoc
measures can result in unreliable, even misleading estimates of the quality of
a treatment policy. We also provide suggestions for mitigating these
effects---for while there is much promise for mining observational health data
to uncover better treatment policies, evaluation must be performed
thoughtfully.

    <title>From Text to Topics in Healthcare Records: An Unsupervised Graph
  Partitioning Methodology</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Healthcare Records contain large volumes of unstructured data,
including extensive free text. Yet this source of detailed information often
remains under-used because of a lack of methodologies to extract interpretable
content in a timely manner. Here we apply network-theoretical tools to analyse
free text in Hospital Patient Incident reports from the National Health
Service, to find clusters of documents with similar content in an unsupervised
manner at different levels of resolution. We combine deep neural network
paragraph vector text-embedding with multiscale Markov Stability community
detection applied to a sparsified similarity graph of document vectors, and
showcase the approach on incident reports from Imperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust, London. The multiscale community structure reveals different levels of
meaning in the topics of the dataset, as shown by descriptive terms extracted
from the clusters of records. We also compare a posteriori against hand-coded
categories assigned by healthcare personnel, and show that our approach
outperforms LDA-based models. Our content clusters exhibit good correspondence
with two levels of hand-coded categories, yet they also provide further medical
detail in certain areas and reveal complementary descriptors of incidents
beyond the external classification taxonomy.

    <title>MyWear: A Smart Wear for Continuous Body Vital Monitoring and Emergency
  Alert</title>
    <summary>  Smart healthcare which is built as healthcare Cyber-Physical System (H-CPS)
from Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) is becoming more important than before.
Medical devices and their connectivity through Internet with alongwith the
electronics health record (EHR) and AI analytics making H-CPS possible.
IoMT-end devices like wearables and implantables are key for H-CPS based smart
healthcare. Smart garment is a specific wearable which can be used for smart
healthcare. There are various smart garments that help users to monitor their
body vitals in real-time. Many commercially available garments collect the
vital data and transmit it to the mobile application for visualization.
However, these don't perform real-time analysis for the user to comprehend
their health conditions. Also, such garments are not included with an alert
system to alert users and contacts in case of emergency. In MyWear, we propose
a wearable body vital monitoring garment that captures physiological data and
automatically analyses such heart rate, stress level, muscle activity to detect
abnormalities. A copy of the physiological data is transmitted to the cloud for
detecting any abnormalities in heart beats and predict any potential heart
failure in future. We also propose a deep neural network (DNN) model that
automatically classifies abnormal heart beat and potential heart failure. For
immediate assistance in such a situation, we propose an alert system that sends
an alert message to nearby medical officials. The proposed MyWear has an
average accuracy of 96.9% and precision of 97.3% for detection of the
abnormalities.

    <title>Internet of Things and Health Care in Pandemic COVID-19: System
  Requirements Evaluation</title>
    <summary>  Technology adoption in healthcare services has resulted in advancing care
delivery services and improving the experiences of patients. This paper
presents research that aims to find the important requirements for a remote
monitoring system for patients with COVID-19. As this pandemic is growing more
and more, there is a critical need for such systems. In this paper, the
requirements and the value are determined for the proposed system, which
integrates a smart bracelet that helps to signal patient vital signs. (376)
participants completed the online quantitative survey. According to the study
results, Most Healthcare Experts, (97.9%) stated that the automated wearable
device is very useful, it plays an essential role in routine healthcare tasks
(in early diagnosis, quarantine enforcement, and patient status monitoring),
and it simplifies their routine healthcare activities. I addition, the main
vital signs based on their expert opinion should include temperature (66% of
participants) and oxygenation level (95% of participants). These findings are
essential to any academic and industrial future efforts to develop these vital
wearable systems. The future work will involve implementing the design based on
the results of this study and use machine-learning algorithm to better detect
the COVID-19 cases based on the monitoring of vital signs and symptoms.

    <title>Large Language Models Illuminate a Progressive Pathway to Artificial
  Healthcare Assistant: A Review</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large language models
(LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mimicking human-level language
comprehension and reasoning. This has sparked significant interest in applying
LLMs to enhance various aspects of healthcare, ranging from medical education
to clinical decision support. However, medicine involves multifaceted data
modalities and nuanced reasoning skills, presenting challenges for integrating
LLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the applications and
implications of LLMs in medicine. It begins by examining the fundamental
applications of general-purpose and specialized LLMs, demonstrating their
utilities in knowledge retrieval, research support, clinical workflow
automation, and diagnostic assistance. Recognizing the inherent multimodality
of medicine, the review then focuses on multimodal LLMs, investigating their
ability to process diverse data types like medical imaging and EHRs to augment
diagnostic accuracy. To address LLMs' limitations regarding personalization and
complex clinical reasoning, the paper explores the emerging development of
LLM-powered autonomous agents for healthcare. Furthermore, it summarizes the
evaluation methodologies for assessing LLMs' reliability and safety in medical
contexts. Overall, this review offers an extensive analysis on the
transformative potential of LLMs in modern medicine. It also highlights the
pivotal need for continuous optimizations and ethical oversight before these
models can be effectively integrated into clinical practice. Visit

    <title>Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics for Multi-Site Modeling of Frail
  and Elderly Patient Services</title>
    <summary>  Recent research has highlighted the potential of linking predictive and
prescriptive analytics. However, it remains widely unexplored how both
paradigms could benefit from one another to address today's major challenges in
healthcare. One of these is smarter planning of resource capacities for frail
and elderly inpatient wards, addressing the societal challenge of an aging
population. Frail and elderly patients typically suffer from multimorbidity and
require more care while receiving medical treatment. The aim of this research
is to assess how various predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both
individually and in tandem, contribute to addressing the operational challenges
within an area of healthcare that is growing in demand. Clinical and
demographic patient attributes are gathered from more than 165,000 patient
records and used to explain and predict length of stay. To that extent, we
employ Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis to establish this
relationship. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic
programs are developed to determine how to optimally plan for beds and ward
staff with the objective to minimize cost. Furthermore, the two analytical
methodologies are linked by generating demand for the prescriptive models using
the CART groupings. The results show the linked methodologies provided
different but similar results compared to using averages and in doing so,
captured a more realistic real-world variation in the patient length of stay.
Our research reveals that healthcare managers should consider using predictive
and prescriptive models to make more informed decisions. By combining
predictive and prescriptive analytics, healthcare managers can move away from
relying on averages and incorporate the unique characteristics of their
patients to create more robust planning decisions, mitigating risks caused by
variations in demand.

    <title>Medical Concept Representation Learning from Claims Data and Application
  to Health Plan Payment Risk Adjustment</title>
    <summary>  Risk adjustment has become an increasingly important tool in healthcare. It
has been extensively applied to payment adjustment for health plans to reflect
the expected cost of providing coverage for members. Risk adjustment models are
typically estimated using linear regression, which does not fully exploit the
information in claims data. Moreover, the development of such linear regression
models requires substantial domain expert knowledge and computational effort
for data preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for risk
adjustment that uses semantic embeddings to represent patient medical
histories. Embeddings efficiently represent medical concepts learned from
diagnostic, procedure, and prescription codes in patients' medical histories.
This approach substantially reduces the need for feature engineering. Our
results show that models using embeddings had better performance than a
commercial risk adjustment model on the task of prospective risk score
prediction.

    <title>Physical Activity Recognition Based on a Parallel Approach for an
  Ensemble of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Classifiers</title>
    <summary>  Human activity recognition (HAR) by wearable sensor devices embedded in the
Internet of things (IOT) can play a significant role in remote health
monitoring and emergency notification, to provide healthcare of higher
standards. The purpose of this study is to investigate a human activity
recognition method of accrued decision accuracy and speed of execution to be
applicable in healthcare. This method classifies wearable sensor acceleration
time series data of human movement using efficient classifier combination of
feature engineering-based and feature learning-based data representation.
Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation of the method with data acquired from 44
subjects wearing a single waist-worn accelerometer on a smart textile, and
engaged in a variety of 10 activities, yields an average recognition rate of
90%, performing significantly better than individual classifiers. The method
easily accommodates functional and computational parallelization to bring
execution time significantly down.

    <title>FERI: A Multitask-based Fairness Achieving Algorithm with Applications
  to Fair Organ Transplantation</title>
    <summary>  Liver transplantation often faces fairness challenges across subgroups
defined by sensitive attributes like age group, gender, and race/ethnicity.
Machine learning models for outcome prediction can introduce additional biases.
To address these, we introduce Fairness through the Equitable Rate of
Improvement in Multitask Learning (FERI) algorithm for fair predictions of
graft failure risk in liver transplant patients. FERI constrains subgroup loss
by balancing learning rates and preventing subgroup dominance in the training
process. Our experiments show that FERI maintains high predictive accuracy with
AUROC and AUPRC comparable to baseline models. More importantly, FERI
demonstrates an ability to improve fairness without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, for gender, FERI reduces the demographic parity disparity by
71.74%, and for the age group, it decreases the equalized odds disparity by
40.46%. Therefore, the FERI algorithm advances fairness-aware predictive
modeling in healthcare and provides an invaluable tool for equitable healthcare
systems.

    <title>Privacy-Preserving Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Sensitive
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  In the realm of healthcare where decentralized facilities are prevalent,
machine learning faces two major challenges concerning the protection of data
and models. The data-level challenge concerns the data privacy leakage when
centralizing data with sensitive personal information. While the model-level
challenge arises from the heterogeneity of local models, which need to be
collaboratively trained while ensuring their confidentiality to address
intellectual property concerns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new
framework termed Abstention-Aware Federated Voting (AAFV) that can
collaboratively and confidentially train heterogeneous local models while
simultaneously protecting the data privacy. This is achieved by integrating a
novel abstention-aware voting mechanism and a differential privacy mechanism
onto local models' predictions. In particular, the proposed abstention-aware
voting mechanism exploits a threshold-based abstention method to select
high-confidence votes from heterogeneous local models, which not only enhances
the learning utility but also protects model confidentiality. Furthermore, we
implement AAFV on two practical prediction tasks of diabetes and in-hospital
patient mortality. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
confidentiality of AAFV in testing accuracy and privacy protection.

    <title>Confederated Machine Learning on Horizontally and Vertically Separated
  Medical Data for Large-Scale Health System Intelligence</title>
    <summary>  Health information is generally fragmented across silos. Though it is
technically feasible to unite data for analysis in a manner that underpins a
rapid learning healthcare system, privacy concerns and regulatory barriers
limit data centralization. Machine learning can be conducted in a federated
manner on patient datasets with the same set of variables, but separated across
sites of care. But federated learning cannot handle the situation where
different data types for a given patient are separated vertically across
different organizations and when patient ID matching across different
institutions is difficult. We call methods that enable machine learning model
training on data separated by two or more degrees confederated machine
learning. We proposed and evaluated a confederated learning to training machine
learning model to stratify the risk of several diseases among when data are
horizontally separated by individual, vertically separated by data type, and
separated by identity without patient ID matching.

    <title>Bridging the gap between AI and Healthcare sides: towards developing
  clinically relevant AI-powered diagnosis systems</title>
    <summary>  Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Network-based Computer-Aided
Diagnosis research, its clinical applications remain challenging. Accordingly,
developing medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) fitting into a clinical
environment requires identifying/bridging the gap between AI and Healthcare
sides. Since the biggest problem in Medical Imaging lies in data paucity,
confirming the clinical relevance for diagnosis of research-proven image
augmentation techniques is essential. Therefore, we hold a clinically valuable
AI-envisioning workshop among Japanese Medical Imaging experts, physicians, and
generalists in Healthcare/Informatics. Then, a questionnaire survey for
physicians evaluates our pathology-aware Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN)-based image augmentation projects in terms of Data Augmentation and
physician training. The workshop reveals the intrinsic gap between
AI/Healthcare sides and solutions on Why (i.e., clinical
significance/interpretation) and How (i.e., data acquisition, commercial
deployment, and safety/feeling safe). This analysis confirms our
pathology-aware GANs' clinical relevance as a clinical decision support system
and non-expert physician training tool. Our findings would play a key role in
connecting inter-disciplinary research and clinical applications, not limited
to the Japanese medical context and pathology-aware GANs.

    <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Ethical Considerations
  and Assessment Checklist</title>
    <summary>  The widespread use of ChatGPT and other emerging technology powered by
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has drawn much attention to
potential ethical issues, especially in high-stakes applications such as
healthcare, but ethical discussions are yet to translate into operationalisable
solutions. Furthermore, ongoing ethical discussions often neglect other types
of GenAI that have been used to synthesise data (e.g., images) for research and
practical purposes, which resolved some ethical issues and exposed others. We
conduct a scoping review of ethical discussions on GenAI in healthcare to
comprehensively analyse gaps in the current research, and further propose to
reduce the gaps by developing a checklist for comprehensive assessment and
transparent documentation of ethical discussions in GenAI research. The
checklist can be readily integrated into the current peer review and
publication system to enhance GenAI research, and may be used for
ethics-related disclosures for GenAI-powered products, healthcare applications
of such products and beyond.

    <title>PHI Scrubber: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  Confidentiality of patient information is an essential part of Electronic
Health Record System. Patient information, if exposed, can cause a serious
damage to the privacy of individuals receiving healthcare. Hence it is
important to remove such details from physician notes. A system is proposed
which consists of a deep learning model where a de-convolutional neural network
and bi-directional LSTM-CNN is used along with regular expressions to recognize
and eliminate the individually identifiable information. This information is
then removed from a medical practitioner's data which further allows the fair
usage of such information among researchers and in clinical trials.

    <title>A Deep Active Survival Analysis Approach for Precision Treatment
  Recommendations: Application of Prostate Cancer</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis has been developed and applied in the number of areas
including manufacturing, finance, economics and healthcare. In healthcare
domain, usually clinical data are high-dimensional, sparse and complex and
sometimes there exists few amount of time-to-event (labeled) instances.
Therefore building an accurate survival model from electronic health records is
challenging. With this motivation, we address this issue and provide a new
survival analysis framework using deep learning and active learning with a
novel sampling strategy. First, our approach provides better representation
with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and
unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by
labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we
introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our
survival model. In the experimental study, we apply our approach on
SEER-Medicare data related to prostate cancer among African-Americans and white
patients. The results indicate that our approach outperforms significantly than
baseline models.

    <title>Optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention policy for Covid-19 epidemic via
  neuroevolution algorithm</title>
    <summary>  National responses to the Covid-19 pandemic varied markedly across countries,
from business-as-usual to complete shutdowns. Policies aimed at disrupting the
viral transmission cycle and preventing the healthcare system from being
overwhelmed, simultaneously exact an economic toll. We developed a intervention
policy model that comprised the relative human, economic and healthcare costs
of non-pharmaceutical epidemic intervention and arrived at the optimal strategy
using the neuroevolution algorithm. The proposed model finds the minimum
required reduction in contact rates to maintain the burden on the healthcare
system below the maximum capacity. We find that such a policy renders a sharp
increase in the control strength at the early stages of the epidemic, followed
by a steady increase in the subsequent ten weeks as the epidemic approaches its
peak, and finally control strength is gradually decreased as the population
moves towards herd immunity. We have also shown how such a model can provide an
efficient adaptive intervention policy at different stages of the epidemic
without having access to the entire history of its progression in the
population. This work emphasizes the importance of imposing intervention
measures early and provides insights into adaptive intervention policies to
minimize the economic impacts of the epidemic without putting an extra burden
on the healthcare system.

    <title>Developing Healthcare Language Model Embedding Spaces</title>
    <summary>  Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle on out-of-domain
datasets like healthcare focused text. We explore specialized pre-training to
adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are
assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training
objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These
schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each
dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces.
Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification
tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer
model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not
further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting
embedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their
publicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of
domain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to
instill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational
budgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in
local healthcare settings. We provide pre-training guidelines for specialized
healthcare LLMs, motivate continued inquiry into contrastive objectives, and
demonstrates adaptation techniques to align small LLMs with privacy-sensitive
medical tasks.

    <title>A hybrid predictive and prescriptive modelling framework for long-term
  mental healthcare workforce planning</title>
    <summary>  Over the past decade, there has been a severe staffing shortage in mental
healthcare, exacerbated by increased demand for mental health services due to
COVID-19. This demand is projected to increase over the next decade or so,
necessitating proactive workforce planning to ensure sufficient staffing for
ongoing service delivery. Despite the subject's critical significance, the
present literature lacks thorough research dedicated to developing a model that
addresses the long-term workforce needs required for efficient mental
healthcare planning. Furthermore, our interactions with mental health
practitioners within the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS)
revealed the practical need for such a model. To address this gap, we aim to
develop a hybrid predictive and prescriptive modelling framework, which
combines long-term probabilistic forecasting with an analytical stock-flow
model, designed specifically for mental health workforce planning. Given the
vital role of nurses, who account for one-third of the total mental health
workforce, we focus on modelling the headcount of nurses, but the proposed
model can be generalised to other types of workforce planning in the healthcare
sector. Using statistical and machine learning approaches and real-world data
from NHS, we first identify factors contributing to variations in workforce
requirements, then develop a long-term forecasting model to estimate future
workforce needs, and finally integrate it into an analytical stock-flow method
to provide policy analysis. Our findings highlight the unsustainable nature of
present staffing plans, showing a growing nursing shortage. Furthermore, the
policy analysis demonstrates the ineffectiveness of blanket remedies,
highlighting the need for regional-level policy developments.

    <title>Unifying Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records Systems via Text-Based
  Code Embedding</title>
    <summary>  Substantial increase in the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has
opened new frontiers for predictive healthcare. However, while EHR systems are
nearly ubiquitous, they lack a unified code system for representing medical
concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a substantial barrier for the
training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale. To
overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a
code-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for
predictive modeling on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of
neural language understanding models while maintaining a neutral approach that
can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific representation learning
or predictive modeling. We tested our model's capacity on various experiments
including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb
shows higher performance in overall experiments compared to code-based
approach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare
research that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.

    <title>Patient Aware Active Learning for Fine-Grained OCT Classification</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers making active learning more sensible from a medical
perspective. In practice, a disease manifests itself in different forms across
patient cohorts. Existing frameworks have primarily used mathematical
constructs to engineer uncertainty or diversity-based methods for selecting the
most informative samples. However, such algorithms do not present themselves
naturally as usable by the medical community and healthcare providers. Thus,
their deployment in clinical settings is very limited, if any. For this
purpose, we propose a framework that incorporates clinical insights into the
sample selection process of active learning that can be incorporated with
existing algorithms. Our medically interpretable active learning framework
captures diverse disease manifestations from patients to improve generalization
performance of OCT classification. After comprehensive experiments, we report
that incorporating patient insights within the active learning framework yields
performance that matches or surpasses five commonly used paradigms on two
architectures with a dataset having imbalanced patient distributions. Also, the
framework integrates within existing medical practices and thus can be used by
healthcare providers.

    <title>Visual Interpretable and Explainable Deep Learning Models for Brain
  Tumor MRI and COVID-19 Chest X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning shows promise for medical image analysis but lacks
interpretability, hindering adoption in healthcare. Attribution techniques that
explain model reasoning may increase trust in deep learning among clinical
stakeholders. This paper aimed to evaluate attribution methods for illuminating
how deep neural networks analyze medical images. Using adaptive path-based
gradient integration, we attributed predictions from brain tumor MRI and
COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets made by recent deep convolutional neural network
models. The technique highlighted possible biomarkers, exposed model biases,
and offered insights into the links between input and prediction. Our analysis
demonstrates the method's ability to elucidate model reasoning on these
datasets. The resulting attributions show promise for improving deep learning
transparency for domain experts by revealing the rationale behind predictions.
This study advances model interpretability to increase trust in deep learning
among healthcare stakeholders.

    <title>Explanation of Machine Learning Models of Colon Cancer Using SHAP
  Considering Interaction Effects</title>
    <summary>  When using machine learning techniques in decision-making processes, the
interpretability of the models is important. Shapley additive explanation
(SHAP) is one of the most promising interpretation methods for machine learning
models. Interaction effects occur when the effect of one variable depends on
the value of another variable. Even if each variable has little effect on the
outcome, its combination can have an unexpectedly large impact on the outcome.
Understanding interactions is important for understanding machine learning
models; however, naive SHAP analysis cannot distinguish between the main effect
and interaction effects. In this paper, we introduce the Shapley-Taylor index
as an interpretation method for machine learning models using SHAP considering
interaction effects. We apply the method to the cancer cohort data of Kyushu
University Hospital (N=29,080) to analyze what combination of factors
contributes to the risk of colon cancer.

    <title>Read, Attend, and Code: Pushing the Limits of Medical Codes Prediction
  from Clinical Notes by Machines</title>
    <summary>  Prediction of medical codes from clinical notes is both a practical and
essential need for every healthcare delivery organization within current
medical systems. Automating annotation will save significant time and excessive
effort spent by human coders today. However, the biggest challenge is directly
identifying appropriate medical codes out of several thousands of
high-dimensional codes from unstructured free-text clinical notes. In the past
three years, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LTSM) networks, there have been vast improvements in tackling the most
challenging benchmark of the MIMIC-III-full-label inpatient clinical notes
dataset. This progress raises the fundamental question of how far automated
machine learning (ML) systems are from human coders' working performance. We
assessed the baseline of human coders' performance on the same subsampled
testing set. We also present our Read, Attend, and Code (RAC) model for
learning the medical code assignment mappings. By connecting convolved
embeddings with self-attention and code-title guided attention modules,
combined with sentence permutation-based data augmentations and stochastic
weight averaging training, RAC establishes a new state of the art (SOTA),
considerably outperforming the current best Macro-F1 by 18.7%, and reaches past
the human-level coding baseline. This new milestone marks a meaningful step
toward fully autonomous medical coding (AMC) in machines reaching parity with
human coders' performance in medical code prediction.

    <title>Understanding Behavior of Clinical Models under Domain Shifts</title>
    <summary>  The hypothesis that computational models can be reliable enough to be adopted
in prognosis and patient care is revolutionizing healthcare. Deep learning, in
particular, has been a game changer in building predictive models, thus leading
to community-wide data curation efforts. However, due to inherent variabilities
in population characteristics and biological systems, these models are often
biased to the training datasets. This can be limiting when models are deployed
in new environments, when there are systematic domain shifts not known a
priori. In this paper, we propose to emulate a large class of domain shifts,
that can occur in clinical settings, with a given dataset, and argue that
evaluating the behavior of predictive models in light of those shifts is an
effective way to quantify their reliability. More specifically, we develop an
approach for building realistic scenarios, based on analysis of \textit{disease
landscapes} in multi-label classification. Using the openly available MIMIC-III
EHR dataset for phenotyping, for the first time, our work sheds light into data
regimes where deep clinical models can fail to generalize. This work emphasizes
the need for novel validation mechanisms driven by real-world domain shifts in
AI for healthcare.

    <title>Adversarial Attacks Against Medical Deep Learning Systems</title>
    <summary>  The discovery of adversarial examples has raised concerns about the practical
deployment of deep learning systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that
adversarial examples are capable of manipulating deep learning systems across
three clinical domains. For each of our representative medical deep learning
classifiers, both white and black box attacks were highly successful. Our
models are representative of the current state of the art in medical computer
vision and, in some cases, directly reflect architectures already seeing
deployment in real world clinical settings. In addition to the technical
contribution of our paper, we synthesize a large body of knowledge about the
healthcare system to argue that medicine may be uniquely susceptible to
adversarial attacks, both in terms of monetary incentives and technical
vulnerability. To this end, we outline the healthcare economy and the
incentives it creates for fraud and provide concrete examples of how and why
such attacks could be realistically carried out. We urge practitioners to be
aware of current vulnerabilities when deploying deep learning systems in
clinical settings, and encourage the machine learning community to further
investigate the domain-specific characteristics of medical learning systems.

    <title>Trading-Off Cost of Deployment Versus Accuracy in Learning Predictive
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Predictive models are finding an increasing number of applications in many
industries. As a result, a practical means for trading-off the cost of
deploying a model versus its effectiveness is needed. Our work is motivated by
risk prediction problems in healthcare. Cost-structures in domains such as
healthcare are quite complex, posing a significant challenge to existing
approaches. We propose a novel framework for designing cost-sensitive
structured regularizers that is suitable for problems with complex cost
dependencies. We draw upon a surprising connection to boolean circuits. In
particular, we represent the problem costs as a multi-layer boolean circuit,
and then use properties of boolean circuits to define an extended feature
vector and a group regularizer that exactly captures the underlying cost
structure. The resulting regularizer may then be combined with a fidelity
function to perform model prediction, for example. For the challenging
real-world application of risk prediction for sepsis in intensive care units,
the use of our regularizer leads to models that are in harmony with the
underlying cost structure and thus provide an excellent prediction accuracy
versus cost tradeoff.

    <title>Large-Scale Study of Temporal Shift in Health Insurance Claims</title>
    <summary>  Most machine learning models for predicting clinical outcomes are developed
using historical data. Yet, even if these models are deployed in the near
future, dataset shift over time may result in less than ideal performance. To
capture this phenomenon, we consider a task--that is, an outcome to be
predicted at a particular time point--to be non-stationary if a historical
model is no longer optimal for predicting that outcome. We build an algorithm
to test for temporal shift either at the population level or within a
discovered sub-population. Then, we construct a meta-algorithm to perform a
retrospective scan for temporal shift on a large collection of tasks. Our
algorithms enable us to perform the first comprehensive evaluation of temporal
shift in healthcare to our knowledge. We create 1,010 tasks by evaluating 242
healthcare outcomes for temporal shift from 2015 to 2020 on a health insurance
claims dataset. 9.7% of the tasks show temporal shifts at the population level,
and 93.0% have some sub-population affected by shifts. We dive into case
studies to understand the clinical implications. Our analysis highlights the
widespread prevalence of temporal shifts in healthcare.

    <title>Pairing Conceptual Modeling with Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Both conceptual modeling and machine learning have long been recognized as
important areas of research. With the increasing emphasis on digitizing and
processing large amounts of data for business and other applications, it would
be helpful to consider how these areas of research can complement each other.
To understand how they can be paired, we provide an overview of machine
learning foundations and development cycle. We then examine how conceptual
modeling can be applied to machine learning and propose a framework for
incorporating conceptual modeling into data science projects. The framework is
illustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse
pairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule
mining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and
machine learning in this this way should help lay the foundations for future
research.

    <title>FedPseudo: Pseudo value-based Deep Learning Models for Federated
  Survival Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis, time-to-event analysis, is an important problem in
healthcare since it has a wide-ranging impact on patients and palliative care.
Many survival analysis methods have assumed that the survival data is centrally
available either from one medical center or by data sharing from multi-centers.
However, the sensitivity of the patient attributes and the strict privacy laws
have increasingly forbidden sharing of healthcare data. To address this
challenge, the research community has looked at the solution of decentralized
training and sharing of model parameters using the Federated Learning (FL)
paradigm. In this paper, we study the utilization of FL for performing survival
analysis on distributed healthcare datasets. Recently, the popular Cox
proportional hazard (CPH) models have been adapted for FL settings; however,
due to its linearity and proportional hazards assumptions, CPH models result in
suboptimal performance, especially for non-linear, non-iid, and heavily
censored survival datasets. To overcome the challenges of existing federated
survival analysis methods, we leverage the predictive accuracy of the deep
learning models and the power of pseudo values to propose a first-of-its-kind,
pseudo value-based deep learning model for federated survival analysis (FSA)
called FedPseudo. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach of deriving pseudo
values for survival probability in the FL settings that speeds up the
computation of pseudo values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our pseudo valued-based FL framework achieves similar
performance as the best centrally trained deep survival analysis model.
Moreover, our proposed FL approach obtains the best results for various
censoring settings.

    <summary>  We discuss deep reinforcement learning in an overview style. We draw a big
picture, filled with details. We discuss six core elements, six important
mechanisms, and twelve applications, focusing on contemporary work, and in
historical contexts. We start with background of artificial intelligence,
machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning (RL), with
resources. Next we discuss RL core elements, including value function, policy,
reward, model, exploration vs. exploitation, and representation. Then we
discuss important mechanisms for RL, including attention and memory,
unsupervised learning, hierarchical RL, multi-agent RL, relational RL, and
learning to learn. After that, we discuss RL applications, including games,
robotics, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, finance, business
management, healthcare, education, energy, transportation, computer systems,
and, science, engineering, and art. Finally we summarize briefly, discuss
challenges and opportunities, and close with an epilogue.

    <title>Causal Regularization</title>
    <summary>  In application domains such as healthcare, we want accurate predictive models
that are also causally interpretable. In pursuit of such models, we propose a
causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable
solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of
Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its
L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive
performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing
a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal
regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms
to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting
multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal
factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable.

    <title>Modeling Disagreement in Automatic Data Labelling for Semi-Supervised
  Learning in Clinical Natural Language Processing</title>
    <summary>  Computational models providing accurate estimates of their uncertainty are
crucial for risk management associated with decision making in healthcare
contexts. This is especially true since many state-of-the-art systems are
trained using the data which has been labelled automatically (self-supervised
mode) and tend to overfit. In this work, we investigate the quality of
uncertainty estimates from a range of current state-of-the-art predictive
models applied to the problem of observation detection in radiology reports.
This problem remains understudied for Natural Language Processing in the
healthcare domain. We demonstrate that Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide
superior performance in quantifying the risks of 3 uncertainty labels based on
the negative log predictive probability (NLPP) evaluation metric and mean
maximum predicted confidence levels (MMPCL), whilst retaining strong predictive
performance.

    <title>Offline Skill Graph (OSG): A Framework for Learning and Planning using
  Offline Reinforcement Learning Skills</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement Learning has received wide interest due to its success in
competitive games. Yet, its adoption in everyday applications is limited (e.g.
industrial, home, healthcare, etc.). In this paper, we address this limitation
by presenting a framework for planning over offline skills and solving complex
tasks in real-world environments. Our framework is comprised of three modules
that together enable the agent to learn from previously collected data and
generalize over it to solve long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate our approach by
testing it on a robotic arm that is required to solve complex tasks.

    <title>Multilevel Weighted Support Vector Machine for Classification on
  Healthcare Data with Missing Values</title>
    <summary>  This work is motivated by the needs of predictive analytics on healthcare
data as represented by Electronic Medical Records. Such data is invariably
problematic: noisy, with missing entries, with imbalance in classes of
interests, leading to serious bias in predictive modeling. Since standard data
mining methods often produce poor performance measures, we argue for
development of specialized techniques of data-preprocessing and classification.
In this paper, we propose a new method to simultaneously classify large
datasets and reduce the effects of missing values. It is based on a multilevel
framework of the cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation
method for missing values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We
compare classification results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public
benchmark datasets with imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real
data in health applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method
produces fast, and more accurate and robust classification results.

    <title>Exploring difference in public perceptions on HPV vaccine between gender
  groups from Twitter using deep learning</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network model for gender
prediction using English Twitter text as input. Ensemble of proposed model
achieved an accuracy at 0.8237 on gender prediction and compared favorably with
the state-of-the-art performance in a recent author profiling task. We further
leveraged the trained models to predict the gender labels from an HPV vaccine
related corpus and identified gender difference in public perceptions regarding
HPV vaccine. The findings are largely consistent with previous survey-based
studies.

    <title>Jekyll: Attacking Medical Image Diagnostics using Deep Generative Models</title>
    <summary>  Advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown tremendous promise in the
medical domain. However, the deep learning tools that are helping the domain,
can also be used against it. Given the prevalence of fraud in the healthcare
domain, it is important to consider the adversarial use of DNNs in manipulating
sensitive data that is crucial to patient healthcare. In this work, we present
the design and implementation of a DNN-based image translation attack on
biomedical imagery. More specifically, we propose Jekyll, a neural style
transfer framework that takes as input a biomedical image of a patient and
translates it to a new image that indicates an attacker-chosen disease
condition. The potential for fraudulent claims based on such generated 'fake'
medical images is significant, and we demonstrate successful attacks on both
X-rays and retinal fundus image modalities. We show that these attacks manage
to mislead both medical professionals and algorithmic detection schemes.
Lastly, we also investigate defensive measures based on machine learning to
detect images generated by Jekyll.

    <title>Towards a Transportable Causal Network Model Based on Observational
  Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Over the last decades, many prognostic models based on artificial
intelligence techniques have been used to provide detailed predictions in
healthcare. Unfortunately, the real-world observational data used to train and
validate these models are almost always affected by biases that can strongly
impact the outcomes validity: two examples are values missing not-at-random and
selection bias. Addressing them is a key element in achieving transportability
and in studying the causal relationships that are critical in clinical decision
making, going beyond simpler statistical approaches based on probabilistic
association.
  In this context, we propose a novel approach that combines selection
diagrams, missingness graphs, causal discovery and prior knowledge into a
single graphical model to estimate the cardiovascular risk of adolescent and
young females who survived breast cancer. We learn this model from data
comprising two different cohorts of patients. The resulting causal network
model is validated by expert clinicians in terms of risk assessment, accuracy
and explainability, and provides a prognostic model that outperforms competing
machine learning methods.

    <title>Quantum Support Vector Machine for Prostate Cancer Detection: A
  Performance Analysis</title>
    <summary>  This study addresses the urgent need for improved prostate cancer detection
methods by harnessing the power of advanced technological solutions. We
introduce the application of Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) to this
critical healthcare challenge, showcasing an enhancement in diagnostic
performance over the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. Our study
not only outlines the remarkable improvements in diagnostic performance made by
QSVM over the classic SVM technique, but it delves into the advancements
brought about by the quantum feature map architecture, which has been carefully
identified and evaluated, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with the unique
characteristics of our prostate cancer dataset. This architecture succeded in
creating a distinct feature space, enabling the detection of complex,
non-linear patterns in the data. The findings reveal not only a comparable
accuracy with classical SVM ($92\%$) but also a $7.14\%$ increase in
sensitivity and a notably high F1-Score ($93.33\%$). This study's important
combination of quantum computing in medical diagnostics marks a pivotal step
forward in cancer detection, offering promising implications for the future of
healthcare technology.

    <title>Med-HALT: Medical Domain Hallucination Test for Large Language Models</title>
    <summary>  This research paper focuses on the challenges posed by hallucinations in
large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the medical
domain. Hallucination, wherein these models generate plausible yet unverified
or incorrect information, can have serious consequences in healthcare
applications. We propose a new benchmark and dataset, Med-HALT (Medical Domain
Hallucination Test), designed specifically to evaluate and reduce
hallucinations. Med-HALT provides a diverse multinational dataset derived from
medical examinations across various countries and includes multiple innovative
testing modalities. Med-HALT includes two categories of tests reasoning and
memory-based hallucination tests, designed to assess LLMs's problem-solving and
information retrieval abilities.
  Our study evaluated leading LLMs, including Text Davinci, GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2,
MPT, and Falcon, revealing significant differences in their performance. The
paper provides detailed insights into the dataset, promoting transparency and
reproducibility. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of
safer and more reliable language models in healthcare. Our benchmark can be

    <title>On the Use of Metaphor Translation in Psychiatry</title>
    <summary>  Providing mental healthcare to individuals with limited English proficiency
(LEP) remains a pressing problem within psychiatry. Because the majority of
individuals trained in providing psychiatric care are English speakers, the
quality of mental healthcare given to LEP patients is significantly lower than
that provided for English speakers. The provision of mental healthcare is
contingent on communication and understanding between the patient and
healthcare provider, much more so than in the realm of physical healthcare, and
English speakers are often unable to comprehend figurative language such as
metaphors used by LEPs. Hence, Figurative Language Translation is invaluable to
providing equitable psychiatric care. Now, metaphor has been shown to be
paramount in both identifying individuals struggling with mental problems and
helping those individuals understand and communicate their experiences.
Therefore, this paper aims to survey the potential of Machine Translation for
providing equitable psychiatric healthcare and highlights the need for further
research on the transferability of existing machine and metaphor translation
research in the domain of psychiatry.

    <title>Grounded Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present the Grounded Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN), a
recurrent neural network architecture for multi-label prediction which
explicitly ties labels to specific dimensions of the recurrent hidden state (we
call this process "grounding"). The approach is particularly well-suited for
extracting large numbers of concepts from text. We apply the new model to
address an important problem in healthcare of understanding what medical
concepts are discussed in clinical text. Using a publicly available dataset
derived from Intensive Care Units, we learn to label a patient's diagnoses and
procedures from their discharge summary. Our evaluation shows a clear advantage
to using our proposed architecture over a variety of strong baselines.

    <title>Deep Neural Networks for Computational Optical Form Measurements</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks have been successfully applied in many different fields
like computational imaging, medical healthcare, signal processing, or
autonomous driving. In a proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate that
computational optical form measurement can also benefit from deep learning. A
data-driven machine learning approach is explored to solve an inverse problem
in the accurate measurement of optical surfaces. The approach is developed and
tested using virtual measurements with known ground truth.

    <title>An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning (RL)
and deep learning. This field of research has been able to solve a wide range
of complex decision-making tasks that were previously out of reach for a
machine. Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as
healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript
provides an introduction to deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and
techniques. Particular focus is on the aspects related to generalization and
how deep RL can be used for practical applications. We assume the reader is
familiar with basic machine learning concepts.

    <title>ShortFuse: Biomedical Time Series Representations in the Presence of
  Structured Information</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare applications, temporal variables that encode movement, health
status and longitudinal patient evolution are often accompanied by rich
structured information such as demographics, diagnostics and medical exam data.
However, current methods do not jointly optimize over structured covariates and
time series in the feature extraction process. We present ShortFuse, a method
that boosts the accuracy of deep learning models for time series by explicitly
modeling temporal interactions and dependencies with structured covariates.
ShortFuse introduces hybrid convolutional and LSTM cells that incorporate the
covariates via weights that are shared across the temporal domain. ShortFuse
outperforms competing models by 3% on two biomedical applications, forecasting
osteoarthritis-related cartilage degeneration and predicting surgical outcomes
for cerebral palsy patients, matching or exceeding the accuracy of models that
use features engineered by domain experts.

    <title>Private Multi-Task Learning: Formulation and Applications to Federated
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Many problems in machine learning rely on multi-task learning (MTL), in which
the goal is to solve multiple related machine learning tasks simultaneously.
MTL is particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive applications in areas such
as healthcare, finance, and IoT computing, where sensitive data from multiple,
varied sources are shared for the purpose of learning. In this work, we
formalize notions of client-level privacy for MTL via joint differential
privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy for mechanism design and
distributed optimization. We then propose an algorithm for mean-regularized
MTL, an objective commonly used for applications in personalized federated
learning, subject to JDP. We analyze our objective and solver, providing
certifiable guarantees on both privacy and utility. Empirically, we find that
our method provides improved privacy/utility trade-offs relative to global
baselines across common federated learning benchmarks.

    <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Enhances Disease Prognosis: Applications
  on COVID-19 and Onward</title>
    <summary>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of interpretable
machine learning techniques has garnered significant attention, offering
transparent and understandable insights crucial for informed clinical decision
making. This literature review delves into the applications of interpretable
machine learning in predicting the prognosis of respiratory diseases,
particularly focusing on COVID-19 and its implications for future research and
clinical practice. We reviewed various machine learning models that are not
only capable of incorporating existing clinical domain knowledge but also have
the learning capability to explore new information from the data. These models
and experiences not only aid in managing the current crisis but also hold
promise for addressing future disease outbreaks. By harnessing interpretable
machine learning, healthcare systems can enhance their preparedness and
response capabilities, thereby improving patient outcomes and mitigating the
impact of respiratory diseases in the years to come.

    <title>Students Need More Attention: BERT-based AttentionModel for Small Data
  with Application to AutomaticPatient Message Triage</title>
    <summary>  Small and imbalanced datasets commonly seen in healthcare represent a
challenge when training classifiers based on deep learning models. So
motivated, we propose a novel framework based on BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers forBiomedical TextMining). Specifically, (i)
we introduce Label Embeddings for Self-Attention in each layer of BERT, which
we call LESA-BERT, and (ii) by distilling LESA-BERT to smaller variants, we aim
to reduce overfitting and model size when working on small datasets. As an
application, our framework is utilized to build a model for patient portal
message triage that classifies the urgency of a message into three categories:
non-urgent, medium and urgent. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can
outperform several strong baseline classifiers by a significant margin of 4.3%
in terms of macro F1 score. The code for this project is publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/shijing001/text_classifiers}.

    <title>Machine learning discrimination of Parkinson's Disease stages from
  walker-mounted sensors data</title>
    <summary>  Clinical methods that assess gait in Parkinson's Disease (PD) are mostly
qualitative. Quantitative methods necessitate costly instrumentation or
cumbersome wearable devices, which limits their usability. Only few of these
methods can discriminate different stages in PD progression. This study applies
machine learning methods to discriminate six stages of PD. The data was
acquired by low cost walker-mounted sensors in an experiment at a movement
disorders clinic and the PD stages were clinically labeled. A large set of
features, some unique to this study are extracted and three feature selection
methods are compared using a multi-class Random Forest (RF) classifier. The
feature subset selected by the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method provided
performance similar to the full feature set: 93% accuracy and had significantly
shorter computation time. Compared to PCA, this method also enabled clinical
interpretability of the selected features, an essential attribute to healthcare
applications. All selected-feature sets are dominated by information theoretic
features and statistical features and offer insights into the characteristics
of gait deterioration in PD. The results indicate a feasibility of machine
learning to accurately classify PD severity stages from kinematic signals
acquired by low-cost, walker-mounted sensors and implies a potential to aid
medical practitioners in the quantitative assessment of PD progression. The
study presents a solution to the small and noisy data problem, which is common
in most sensor-based healthcare assessments.

    <title>Federated Graph Machine Learning: A Survey of Concepts, Techniques, and
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Graph machine learning has gained great attention in both academia and
industry recently. Most of the graph machine learning models, such as Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), are trained over massive graph data. However, in many
real-world scenarios, such as hospitalization prediction in healthcare systems,
the graph data is usually stored at multiple data owners and cannot be directly
accessed by any other parties due to privacy concerns and regulation
restrictions. Federated Graph Machine Learning (FGML) is a promising solution
to tackle this challenge by training graph machine learning models in a
federated manner. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the
literature in FGML. Specifically, we first provide a new taxonomy to divide the
existing problems in FGML into two settings, namely, FL with structured data
and structured FL. Then, we review the mainstream techniques in each setting
and elaborate on how they address the challenges under FGML. In addition, we
summarize the real-world applications of FGML from different domains and
introduce open graph datasets and platforms adopted in FGML. Finally, we
present several limitations in the existing studies with promising research
directions in this field.

    <title>Anonymizing Data for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning enables training a global machine learning model from data
distributed across multiple sites, without having to move the data. This is
particularly relevant in healthcare applications, where data is rife with
personal, highly-sensitive information, and data analysis methods must provably
comply with regulatory guidelines. Although federated learning prevents sharing
raw data, it is still possible to launch privacy attacks on the model
parameters that are exposed during the training process, or on the generated
machine learning model. In this paper, we propose the first syntactic approach
for offering privacy in the context of federated learning. Unlike the
state-of-the-art differential privacy-based frameworks, our approach aims to
maximize utility or model performance, while supporting a defensible level of
privacy, as demanded by GDPR and HIPAA. We perform a comprehensive empirical
evaluation on two important problems in the healthcare domain, using real-world
electronic health data of 1 million patients. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving high model performance, while
offering the desired level of privacy. Through comparative studies, we also
show that, for varying datasets, experimental setups, and privacy budgets, our
approach offers higher model performance than differential privacy-based
techniques in federated learning.

    <title>Agree to Disagree: When Deep Learning Models With Identical
  Architectures Produce Distinct Explanations</title>
    <summary>  Deep Learning of neural networks has progressively become more prominent in
healthcare with models reaching, or even surpassing, expert accuracy levels.
However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of
model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients'
sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of
these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations
are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the
classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about
trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models
capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious
correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that
the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary
significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how
the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency
which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We
find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a
low consistency: $\approx$ 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are
robust against any orthogonal changes, with explanation consistency at 94%. We
conclude that current trends in model explanation are not sufficient to
mitigate the risks of deploying models in real life healthcare applications.

    <title>GenHPF: General Healthcare Predictive Framework with Multi-task
  Multi-source Learning</title>
    <summary>  Despite the remarkable progress in the development of predictive models for
healthcare, applying these algorithms on a large scale has been challenging.
Algorithms trained on a particular task, based on specific data formats
available in a set of medical records, tend to not generalize well to other
tasks or databases in which the data fields may differ. To address this
challenge, we propose General Healthcare Predictive Framework (GenHPF), which
is applicable to any EHR with minimal preprocessing for multiple prediction
tasks. GenHPF resolves heterogeneity in medical codes and schemas by converting
EHRs into a hierarchical textual representation while incorporating as many
features as possible. To evaluate the efficacy of GenHPF, we conduct multi-task
learning experiments with single-source and multi-source settings, on three
publicly available EHR datasets with different schemas for 12 clinically
meaningful prediction tasks. Our framework significantly outperforms baseline
models that utilize domain knowledge in multi-source learning, improving
average AUROC by 1.2%P in pooled learning and 2.6%P in transfer learning while
also showing comparable results when trained on a single EHR dataset.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining using multi-source
datasets is effective when combined with GenHPF, resulting in a 0.6%P AUROC
improvement compared to models without pretraining. By eliminating the need for
preprocessing and feature engineering, we believe that this work offers a solid
framework for multi-task and multi-source learning that can be leveraged to
speed up the scaling and usage of predictive algorithms in healthcare.

    <title>Enhancing Readmission Prediction with Deep Learning: Extracting
  Biomedical Concepts from Clinical Texts</title>
    <summary>  Hospital readmission, defined as patients being re-hospitalized shortly after
discharge, is a critical concern as it impacts patient outcomes and healthcare
costs. Identifying patients at risk of readmission allows for timely
interventions, reducing re-hospitalization rates and overall treatment costs.
This study focuses on predicting patient readmission within less than 30 days
using text mining techniques applied to discharge report texts from electronic
health records (EHR). Various machine learning and deep learning methods were
employed to develop a classification model for this purpose. A novel aspect of
this research involves leveraging the Bio-Discharge Summary Bert (BDSS) model
along with principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction to preprocess
data for deep learning model input. Our analysis of the MIMIC-III dataset
indicates that our approach, which combines the BDSS model with a multilayer
perceptron (MLP), outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This model achieved a
recall of 94% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 75%, showcasing its
effectiveness in predicting patient readmissions. This study contributes to the
advancement of predictive modeling in healthcare by integrating text mining
techniques with deep learning algorithms to improve patient outcomes and
optimize resource allocation.

    <title>ESCAPED: Efficient Secure and Private Dot Product Framework for
  Kernel-based Machine Learning Algorithms with Applications in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  To train sophisticated machine learning models one usually needs many
training samples. Especially in healthcare settings these samples can be very
expensive, meaning that one institution alone usually does not have enough on
its own. Merging privacy-sensitive data from different sources is usually
restricted by data security and data protection measures. This can lead to
approaches that reduce data quality by putting noise onto the variables (e.g.,
in $\epsilon$-differential privacy) or omitting certain values (e.g., for
$k$-anonymity). Other measures based on cryptographic methods can lead to very
time-consuming computations, which is especially problematic for larger
multi-omics data. We address this problem by introducing ESCAPED, which stands
for Efficient SeCure And PrivatE Dot product framework, enabling the
computation of the dot product of vectors from multiple sources on a
third-party, which later trains kernel-based machine learning algorithms, while
neither sacrificing privacy nor adding noise. We evaluated our framework on
drug resistance prediction for HIV-infected people and multi-omics
dimensionality reduction and clustering problems in precision medicine. In
terms of execution time, our framework significantly outperforms the
best-fitting existing approaches without sacrificing the performance of the
algorithm. Even though we only show the benefit for kernel-based algorithms,
our framework can open up new research opportunities for further machine
learning models that require the dot product of vectors from multiple sources.

    <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms in Classifying Postoperative
  Success in Metabolic Bariatric Surgery: A Comprehensive Study</title>
    <summary>  Objectives: Metabolic Bariatric Surgery (MBS) is a critical intervention for
patients living with obesity and related health issues. Accurate classification
and prediction of patient outcomes are vital for optimizing treatment
strategies. This study presents a novel machine learning approach to classify
patients in the context of metabolic bariatric surgery, providing insights into
the efficacy of different models and variable types. Methods: Various machine
learning models, including GaussianNB, ComplementNB, KNN, Decision Tree, KNN
with RandomOverSampler, and KNN with SMOTE, were applied to a dataset of 73
patients. The dataset, comprising psychometric, socioeconomic, and analytical
variables, was analyzed to determine the most efficient predictive model. The
study also explored the impact of different variable groupings and oversampling
techniques. Results: Experimental results indicate average accuracy values as
high as 66.7% for the best model. Enhanced versions of KNN and Decision Tree,
along with variations of KNN such as RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, yielded the
best results. Conclusions: The study unveils a promising avenue for classifying
patients in the realm of metabolic bariatric surgery. The results underscore
the importance of selecting appropriate variables and employing diverse
approaches to achieve optimal performance. The developed system holds potential
as a tool to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making, thereby
enhancing metabolic bariatric surgery outcomes. These findings lay the
groundwork for future collaboration between hospitals and healthcare entities
to improve patient care through the utilization of machine learning algorithms.
Moreover, the findings suggest room for improvement, potentially achievable
with a larger dataset and careful parameter tuning.

    <title>EdgeLaaS: Edge Learning as a Service for Knowledge-Centric Connected
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  By introducing networking technologies and services into healthcare
infrastructures (e.g., multimodal sensors and smart devices) that are deployed
to supervise a person's health condition, the traditional healthcare system is
being revolutionized toward knowledge-centric connected healthcare (KCCH),
where persons will take their own responsibility for their healthcare in a
knowledge-centric way. Due to the volume, velocity, and variety of healthcare
supervision data generated by these healthcare infrastructures, an urgent and
strategic issue is how to efficiently process a person's healthcare supervision
data with the right knowledge of the right guardians (e.g., relatives, nurses,
and doctors) at the right time. To solve this issue, the naming and routing
criterion of medical knowledge is studied. With this offloaded medical
knowledge, we propose an edge learning as a service (EdgeLaaS) framework for
KCCH to locally process health supervision data. In this framework, edge
learning nodes can help the patient choose better advice from the right
guardians in real time when some emergencies occur. Two application cases: 1)
fast self-help and 2) mobile help pre-calling are studied. Performance
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of KCCH and EdgeLaaS, respectively.

    <title>BrainNNExplainer: An Interpretable Graph Neural Network Framework for
  Brain Network based Disease Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Interpretable brain network models for disease prediction are of great value
for the advancement of neuroscience. GNNs are promising to model complicated
network data, but they are prone to overfitting and suffer from poor
interpretability, which prevents their usage in decision-critical scenarios
like healthcare. To bridge this gap, we propose BrainNNExplainer, an
interpretable GNN framework for brain network analysis. It is mainly composed
of two jointly learned modules: a backbone prediction model that is
specifically designed for brain networks and an explanation generator that
highlights disease-specific prominent brain network connections. Extensive
experimental results with visualizations on two challenging disease prediction
datasets demonstrate the unique interpretability and outstanding performance of
BrainNNExplainer.

    <title>Exploring the added value of blockchain technology for the healthcare
  domain</title>
    <summary>  In this report, the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) has written
down lessons learned on how blockchain technology can have an impact on the
healthcare domain. By looking at two use-cases, the hospital challenged several
teams, participating in an open innovation program and blockchain hackathon, to
find a solution that showed the added value of the technology for patient care
and scientific research. Besides this practical perspective, the report also
considers literature discussing the current state of blockchain technology in
regard to developments in the healthcare domain (touching on patient
empowerment, data management, regulations, and interoperability between
healthcare systems).

    <title>Machine Learning Approaches for Fine-Grained Symptom Estimation in
  Schizophrenia: A Comprehensive Review</title>
    <summary>  Schizophrenia is a severe yet treatable mental disorder, it is diagnosed
using a multitude of primary and secondary symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment
for each individual depends on the severity of the symptoms, therefore there is
a need for accurate, personalised assessments. However, the process can be both
time-consuming and subjective; hence, there is a motivation to explore
automated methods that can offer consistent diagnosis and precise symptom
assessments, thereby complementing the work of healthcare practitioners.
Machine Learning has demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous
domains, including medicine; the use of Machine Learning in patient assessment
holds great promise for healthcare professionals and patients alike, as it can
lead to more consistent and accurate symptom estimation.This survey aims to
review methodologies that utilise Machine Learning for diagnosis and assessment
of schizophrenia. Contrary to previous reviews that primarily focused on binary
classification, this work recognises the complexity of the condition and
instead, offers an overview of Machine Learning methods designed for
fine-grained symptom estimation. We cover multiple modalities, namely Medical
Imaging, Electroencephalograms and Audio-Visual, as the illness symptoms can
manifest themselves both in a patient's pathology and behaviour. Finally, we
analyse the datasets and methodologies used in the studies and identify trends,
gaps as well as opportunities for future research.

    <title>Enabling End-to-End Secure Federated Learning in Biomedical Research on
  Heterogeneous Computing Environments with APPFLx</title>
    <summary>  Facilitating large-scale, cross-institutional collaboration in biomedical
machine learning projects requires a trustworthy and resilient federated
learning (FL) environment to ensure that sensitive information such as
protected health information is kept confidential. In this work, we introduce
APPFLx, a low-code FL framework that enables the easy setup, configuration, and
running of FL experiments across organizational and administrative boundaries
while providing secure end-to-end communication, privacy-preserving
functionality, and identity management. APPFLx is completely agnostic to the
underlying computational infrastructure of participating clients. We
demonstrate the capability of APPFLx as an easy-to-use framework for
accelerating biomedical studies across institutions and healthcare systems
while maintaining the protection of private medical data in two case studies:
(1) predicting participant age from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms, and (2)
detecting COVID-19 disease from chest radiographs. These experiments were
performed securely across heterogeneous compute resources, including a mixture
of on-premise high-performance computing and cloud computing, and highlight the
role of federated learning in improving model generalizability and performance
when aggregating data from multiple healthcare systems. Finally, we demonstrate
that APPFLx serves as a convenient and easy-to-use framework for accelerating
biomedical studies across institutions and healthcare system while maintaining
the protection of private medical data.

    <title>Improving healthcare access management by predicting patient no-show
  behaviour</title>
    <summary>  Low attendance levels in medical appointments have been associated with poor
health outcomes and efficiency problems for service providers. To address this
problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or
minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation
policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating
relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the
decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers
have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment
characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities.
This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the
implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care
program targeted at underserved communities in Bogot\'a, Colombia. Our
contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness
of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression
models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the
problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we
propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the
explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the
modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities
in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for
improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported
in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics
affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient prioritization
in a pilot behavioural intervention and will inform appointment planning
decisions.

    <title>Comparison of Machine Learning Classification Algorithms and Application
  to the Framingham Heart Study</title>
    <summary>  The use of machine learning algorithms in healthcare can amplify social
injustices and health inequities. While the exacerbation of biases can occur
and compound during the problem selection, data collection, and outcome
definition, this research pertains to some generalizability impediments that
occur during the development and the post-deployment of machine learning
classification algorithms. Using the Framingham coronary heart disease data as
a case study, we show how to effectively select a probability cutoff to convert
a regression model for a dichotomous variable into a classifier. We then
compare the sampling distribution of the predictive performance of eight
machine learning classification algorithms under four training/testing
scenarios to test their generalizability and their potential to perpetuate
biases. We show that both the Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector
Machine are flawed when trained on an unbalanced dataset. We introduced and
show that the double discriminant scoring of type I is the most generalizable
as it consistently outperforms the other classification algorithms regardless
of the training/testing scenario. Finally, we introduce a methodology to
extract an optimal variable hierarchy for a classification algorithm, and
illustrate it on the overall, male and female Framingham coronary heart disease
data.

    <title>Investigating the validity of structure learning algorithms in
  identifying risk factors for intervention in patients with diabetes</title>
    <summary>  Diabetes, a pervasive and enduring health challenge, imposes significant
global implications on health, financial healthcare systems, and societal
well-being. This study undertakes a comprehensive exploration of various
structural learning algorithms to discern causal pathways amongst potential
risk factors influencing diabetes progression. The methodology involves the
application of these algorithms to relevant diabetes data, followed by the
conversion of their output graphs into Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs),
enabling predictive analysis and the evaluation of discrepancies in the effect
of hypothetical interventions within our context-specific case study.
  This study highlights the substantial impact of algorithm selection on
intervention outcomes. To consolidate insights from diverse algorithms, we
employ a model-averaging technique that helps us obtain a unique causal model
for diabetes derived from a varied set of structural learning algorithms. We
also investigate how each of those individual graphs, as well as the average
graph, compare to the structures elicited by a domain expert who categorised
graph edges into high confidence, moderate, and low confidence types, leading
into three individual graphs corresponding to the three levels of confidence.
  The resulting causal model and data are made available online, and serve as a
valuable resource and a guide for informed decision-making by healthcare
practitioners, offering a comprehensive understanding of the interactions
between relevant risk factors and the effect of hypothetical interventions.
Therefore, this research not only contributes to the academic discussion on
diabetes, but also provides practical guidance for healthcare professionals in
developing efficient intervention and risk management strategies.

    <title>Curvature-based Feature Selection with Application in Classifying
  Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Disruptive technologies provides unparalleled opportunities to contribute to
the identifications of many aspects in pervasive healthcare, from the adoption
of the Internet of Things through to Machine Learning (ML) techniques. As a
powerful tool, ML has been widely applied in patient-centric healthcare
solutions. To further improve the quality of patient care, Electronic Health
Records (EHRs) are commonly adopted in healthcare facilities for analysis. It
is a crucial task to apply AI and ML to analyse those EHRs for prediction and
diagnostics due to their highly unstructured, unbalanced, incomplete, and
high-dimensional nature. Dimensionality reduction is a common data
preprocessing technique to cope with high-dimensional EHR data, which aims to
reduce the number of features of EHR representation while improving the
performance of the subsequent data analysis, e.g. classification. In this work,
an efficient filter-based feature selection method, namely Curvature-based
Feature Selection (CFS), is presented. The proposed CFS applied the concept of
Menger Curvature to rank the weights of all features in the given data set. The
performance of the proposed CFS has been evaluated in four well-known EHR data
sets, including Cervical Cancer Risk Factors (CCRFDS), Breast Cancer Coimbra
(BCCDS), Breast Tissue (BTDS), and Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen (DRDDS). The
experimental results show that the proposed CFS achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the above data sets against conventional PCA and other most
recent approaches. The source code of the proposed approach is publicly
available at https://github.com/zhemingzuo/CFS.

    <title>Experimenting with an Evaluation Framework for Imbalanced Data Learning
  (EFIDL)</title>
    <summary>  Introduction Data imbalance is one of the crucial issues in big data analysis
with fewer labels. For example, in real-world healthcare data, spam detection
labels, and financial fraud detection datasets. Many data balance methods were
introduced to improve machine learning algorithms' performance. Research claims
SMOTE and SMOTE-based data-augmentation (generate new data points) methods
could improve algorithm performance. However, we found in many online
tutorials, the valuation methods were applied based on synthesized datasets
that introduced bias into the evaluation, and the performance got a false
improvement. In this study, we proposed, a new evaluation framework for
imbalanced data learning methods. We have experimented on five data balance
methods and whether the performance of algorithms will improve or not. Methods
We collected 8 imbalanced healthcare datasets with different imbalanced rates
from different domains. Applied 6 data augmentation methods with 11 machine
learning methods testing if the data augmentation will help with improving
machine learning performance. We compared the traditional data augmentation
evaluation methods with our proposed cross-validation evaluation framework
Results Using traditional data augmentation evaluation meta hods will give a
false impression of improving the performance. However, our proposed evaluation
method shows data augmentation has limited ability to improve the results.
Conclusion EFIDL is more suitable for evaluating the prediction performance of
an ML method when data are augmented. Using an unsuitable evaluation framework
will give false results. Future researchers should consider the evaluation
framework we proposed when dealing with augmented datasets. Our experiments
showed data augmentation does not help improve ML prediction performance.

    <title>Attention on Personalized Clinical Decision Support System: Federated
  Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  Health management has become a primary problem as new kinds of diseases and
complex symptoms are introduced to a rapidly growing modern society. Building a
better and smarter healthcare infrastructure is one of the ultimate goals of a
smart city. To the best of our knowledge, neural network models are already
employed to assist healthcare professionals in achieving this goal. Typically,
training a neural network requires a rich amount of data but heterogeneous and
vulnerable properties of clinical data introduce a challenge for the
traditional centralized network. Moreover, adding new inputs to a medical
database requires re-training an existing model from scratch. To tackle these
challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system
trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm. We focused on a novel
strategy to guarantee the safety of patient privacy and overcome the risk of
cyberattacks while enabling large-scale clinical data mining. As a result, we
can leverage rich clinical data for training each local neural network without
the need for exchanging the confidential data of patients. Moreover, we
implemented the proposed scheme as a sequence-to-sequence model architecture
integrating the attention mechanism. Thus, our objective is to provide a
personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable characteristics
that can deliver accurate solutions and assist healthcare professionals in
medical diagnosing.

    <title>Synthesizing Skeletal Motion and Physiological Signals as a Function of
  a Virtual Human's Actions and Emotions</title>
    <summary>  Round-the-clock monitoring of human behavior and emotions is required in many
healthcare applications which is very expensive but can be automated using
machine learning (ML) and sensor technologies. Unfortunately, the lack of
infrastructure for collection and sharing of such data is a bottleneck for ML
research applied to healthcare. Our goal is to circumvent this bottleneck by
simulating a human body in virtual environment. This will allow generation of
potentially infinite amounts of shareable data from an individual as a function
of his actions, interactions and emotions in a care facility or at home, with
no risk of confidentiality breach or privacy invasion. In this paper, we
develop for the first time a system consisting of computational models for
synchronously synthesizing skeletal motion, electrocardiogram, blood pressure,
respiration, and skin conductance signals as a function of an open-ended set of
actions and emotions. Our experimental evaluations, involving user studies,
benchmark datasets and comparison to findings in the literature, show that our
models can generate skeletal motion and physiological signals with high
fidelity. The proposed framework is modular and allows the flexibility to
experiment with different models. In addition to facilitating ML research for
round-the-clock monitoring at a reduced cost, the proposed framework will allow
reusability of code and data, and may be used as a training tool for ML
practitioners and healthcare professionals.

    <title>Systematically Assessing the Security Risks of AI/ML-enabled Connected
  Healthcare Systems</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of machine-learning-enabled systems in the healthcare domain is
on the rise. While the use of ML in healthcare has several benefits, it also
expands the threat surface of medical systems. We show that the use of ML in
medical systems, particularly connected systems that involve interfacing the ML
engine with multiple peripheral devices, has security risks that might cause
life-threatening damage to a patient's health in case of adversarial
interventions. These new risks arise due to security vulnerabilities in the
peripheral devices and communication channels. We present a case study where we
demonstrate an attack on an ML-enabled blood glucose monitoring system by
introducing adversarial data points during inference. We show that an adversary
can achieve this by exploiting a known vulnerability in the Bluetooth
communication channel connecting the glucose meter with the ML-enabled app. We
further show that state-of-the-art risk assessment techniques are not adequate
for identifying and assessing these new risks. Our study highlights the need
for novel risk analysis methods for analyzing the security of AI-enabled
connected health devices.

    <title>Interpreting Machine Learning Malware Detectors Which Leverage N-gram
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In cyberattack detection and prevention systems, cybersecurity analysts
always prefer solutions that are as interpretable and understandable as
rule-based or signature-based detection. This is because of the need to tune
and optimize these solutions to mitigate and control the effect of false
positives and false negatives. Interpreting machine learning models is a new
and open challenge. However, it is expected that an interpretable machine
learning solution will be domain-specific. For instance, interpretable
solutions for machine learning models in healthcare are different than
solutions in malware detection. This is because the models are complex, and
most of them work as a black-box. Recently, the increased ability for malware
authors to bypass antimalware systems has forced security specialists to look
to machine learning for creating robust detection systems. If these systems are
to be relied on in the industry, then, among other challenges, they must also
explain their predictions. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the
current state-of-the-art ML models interpretability techniques when applied to
ML-based malware detectors. We demonstrate interpretability techniques in
practice and evaluate the effectiveness of existing interpretability techniques
in the malware analysis domain.

    <title>A Hybrid Instance-based Transfer Learning Method</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, supervised machine learning models have demonstrated
tremendous success in a variety of application domains. Despite the promising
results, these successful models are data hungry and their performance relies
heavily on the size of training data. However, in many healthcare applications
it is difficult to collect sufficiently large training datasets. Transfer
learning can help overcome this issue by transferring the knowledge from
readily available datasets (source) to a new dataset (target). In this work, we
propose a hybrid instance-based transfer learning method that outperforms a set
of baselines including state-of-the-art instance-based transfer learning
approaches. Our method uses a probabilistic weighting strategy to fuse
information from the source domain to the model learned in the target domain.
Our method is generic, applicable to multiple source domains, and robust with
respect to negative transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments for two different applications.

    <title>Autocompletion of Chief Complaints in the Electronic Health Records
  using Large Language Models</title>
    <summary>  The Chief Complaint (CC) is a crucial component of a patient's medical record
as it describes the main reason or concern for seeking medical care. It
provides critical information for healthcare providers to make informed
decisions about patient care. However, documenting CCs can be time-consuming
for healthcare providers, especially in busy emergency departments. To address
this issue, an autocompletion tool that suggests accurate and well-formatted
phrases or sentences for clinical notes can be a valuable resource for triage
nurses. In this study, we utilized text generation techniques to develop
machine learning models using CC data. In our proposed work, we train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and fine-tune three different variants of
Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT), namely
microsoft/biogpt, microsoft/BioGPT-Large, and microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA.
Additionally, we tune a prompt by incorporating exemplar CC sentences,
utilizing the OpenAI API of GPT-4. We evaluate the models' performance based on
the perplexity score, modified BERTScore, and cosine similarity score. The
results show that BioGPT-Large exhibits superior performance compared to the
other models. It consistently achieves a remarkably low perplexity score of
1.65 when generating CC, whereas the baseline LSTM model achieves the best
perplexity score of 170. Further, we evaluate and assess the proposed models'
performance and the outcome of GPT-4.0. Our study demonstrates that utilizing
LLMs such as BioGPT, leads to the development of an effective autocompletion
tool for generating CC documentation in healthcare settings.

    <title>User Engagement in Mobile Health Applications</title>
    <summary>  Mobile health apps are revolutionizing the healthcare ecosystem by improving
communication, efficiency, and quality of service. In low- and middle-income
countries, they also play a unique role as a source of information about health
outcomes and behaviors of patients and healthcare workers, while providing a
suitable channel to deliver both personalized and collective policy
interventions. We propose a framework to study user engagement with mobile
health, focusing on healthcare workers and digital health apps designed to
support them in resource-poor settings. The behavioral logs produced by these
apps can be transformed into daily time series characterizing each user's
activity. We use probabilistic and survival analysis to build multiple
personalized measures of meaningful engagement, which could serve to tailor
content and digital interventions suiting each health worker's specific needs.
Special attention is given to the problem of detecting churn, understood as a
marker of complete disengagement. We discuss the application of our methods to
the Indian and Ethiopian users of the Safe Delivery App, a capacity-building
tool for skilled birth attendants. This work represents an important step
towards a full characterization of user engagement in mobile health
applications, which can significantly enhance the abilities of health workers
and, ultimately, save lives.

    <title>Dynamic Knowledge Distillation for Black-box Hypothesis Transfer
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  In real world applications like healthcare, it is usually difficult to build
a machine learning prediction model that works universally well across
different institutions. At the same time, the available model is often
proprietary, i.e., neither the model parameter nor the data set used for model
training is accessible. In consequence, leveraging the knowledge hidden in the
available model (aka. the hypothesis) and adapting it to a local data set
becomes extremely challenging. Motivated by this situation, in this paper we
aim to address such a specific case within the hypothesis transfer learning
framework, in which 1) the source hypothesis is a black-box model and 2) the
source domain data is unavailable. In particular, we introduce a novel
algorithm called dynamic knowledge distillation for hypothesis transfer
learning (dkdHTL). In this method, we use knowledge distillation with
instance-wise weighting mechanism to adaptively transfer the "dark" knowledge
from the source hypothesis to the target domain.The weighting coefficients of
the distillation loss and the standard loss are determined by the consistency
between the predicted probability of the source hypothesis and the target
ground-truth label.Empirical results on both transfer learning benchmark
datasets and a healthcare dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    <title>Integration of Federated Learning and Blockchain in Healthcare: A
  Tutorial</title>
    <summary>  Wearable devices and medical sensors revolutionize health monitoring, raising
concerns about data privacy in ML for healthcare. This tutorial explores FL and
BC integration, offering a secure and privacy-preserving approach to healthcare
analytics. FL enables decentralized model training on local devices at
healthcare institutions, keeping patient data localized. This facilitates
collaborative model development without compromising privacy. However, FL
introduces vulnerabilities. BC, with its tamper-proof ledger and smart
contracts, provides a robust framework for secure collaborative learning in FL.
After presenting a taxonomy for the various types of data used in ML in medical
applications, and a concise review of ML techniques for healthcare use cases,
this tutorial explores three integration architectures for balancing
decentralization, scalability, and reliability in healthcare data. Furthermore,
it investigates how BCFL enhances data security and collaboration in disease
prediction, medical image analysis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery. By
providing a tutorial on FL, blockchain, and their integration, along with a
review of BCFL applications, this paper serves as a valuable resource for
researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage these technologies for secure
and privacy-preserving healthcare ML. It aims to accelerate advancements in
secure and collaborative healthcare analytics, ultimately improving patient
outcomes.

    <title>Hebbian Continual Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  Continual Learning aims to bring machine learning into a more realistic
scenario, where tasks are learned sequentially and the i.i.d. assumption is not
preserved. Although this setting is natural for biological systems, it proves
very difficult for machine learning models such as artificial neural networks.
To reduce this performance gap, we investigate the question whether
biologically inspired Hebbian learning is useful for tackling continual
challenges. In particular, we highlight a realistic and often overlooked
unsupervised setting, where the learner has to build representations without
any supervision. By combining sparse neural networks with Hebbian learning
principle, we build a simple yet effective alternative (HebbCL) to typical
neural network models trained via the gradient descent. Due to Hebbian
learning, the network have easily interpretable weights, which might be
essential in critical application such as security or healthcare. We
demonstrate the efficacy of HebbCL in an unsupervised learning setting applied
to MNIST and Omniglot datasets. We also adapt the algorithm to the supervised
scenario and obtain promising results in the class-incremental learning.

    <title>An Automated Method to Enrich Consumer Health Vocabularies Using GloVe
  Word Embeddings and An Auxiliary Lexical Resource</title>
    <summary>  Background: Clear language makes communication easier between any two
parties. A layman may have difficulty communicating with a professional due to
not understanding the specialized terms common to the domain. In healthcare, it
is rare to find a layman knowledgeable in medical terminology which can lead to
poor understanding of their condition and/or treatment. To bridge this gap,
several professional vocabularies and ontologies have been created to map
laymen medical terms to professional medical terms and vice versa.
  Objective: Many of the presented vocabularies are built manually or
semi-automatically requiring large investments of time and human effort and
consequently the slow growth of these vocabularies. In this paper, we present
an automatic method to enrich laymen's vocabularies that has the benefit of
being able to be applied to vocabularies in any domain.
  Methods: Our entirely automatic approach uses machine learning, specifically
Global Vectors for Word Embeddings (GloVe), on a corpus collected from a social
media healthcare platform to extend and enhance consumer health vocabularies
(CHV). Our approach further improves the CHV by incorporating synonyms and
hyponyms from the WordNet ontology. The basic GloVe and our novel algorithms
incorporating WordNet were evaluated using two laymen datasets from the
National Library of Medicine (NLM), Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC
CHV) and MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary.
  Results: The results show that GloVe was able to find new laymen terms with
an F-score of 48.44%. Furthermore, our enhanced GloVe approach outperformed
basic GloVe with an average F-score of 61%, a relative improvement of 25%.
Furthermore, the enhanced GloVe showed a statistical significance over the two
ground truth datasets with P&lt;.001.

    <title>Construction of extra-large scale screening tools for risks of severe
  mental illnesses using real world healthcare data</title>
    <summary>  Importance: The prevalence of severe mental illnesses (SMIs) in the United
States is approximately 3% of the whole population. The ability to conduct risk
screening of SMIs at large scale could inform early prevention and treatment.
  Objective: A scalable machine learning based tool was developed to conduct
population-level risk screening for SMIs, including schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorders, psychosis, and bipolar disorders,using 1) healthcare
insurance claims and 2) electronic health records (EHRs).
  Design, setting and participants: Data from beneficiaries from a nationwide
commercial healthcare insurer with 77.4 million members and data from patients
from EHRs from eight academic hospitals based in the U.S. were used. First, the
predictive models were constructed and tested using data in case-control
cohorts from insurance claims or EHR data. Second, performance of the
predictive models across data sources were analyzed. Third, as an illustrative
application, the models were further trained to predict risks of SMIs among
18-year old young adults and individuals with substance associated conditions.
  Main outcomes and measures: Machine learning-based predictive models for SMIs
in the general population were built based on insurance claims and EHR.

    <title>Privacy Preserving Data Imputation via Multi-party Computation for
  Medical Applications</title>
    <summary>  Handling missing data is crucial in machine learning, but many datasets
contain gaps due to errors or non-response. Unlike traditional methods such as
listwise deletion, which are simple but inadequate, the literature offers more
sophisticated and effective methods, thereby improving sample size and
accuracy. However, these methods require accessing the whole dataset, which
contradicts the privacy regulations when the data is distributed among multiple
sources. Especially in the medical and healthcare domain, such access reveals
sensitive information about patients. This study addresses privacy-preserving
imputation methods for sensitive data using secure multi-party computation,
enabling secure computations without revealing any party's sensitive
information. In this study, we realized the mean, median, regression, and kNN
imputation methods in a privacy-preserving way. We specifically target the
medical and healthcare domains considering the significance of protection of
the patient data, showcasing our methods on a diabetes dataset. Experiments on
the diabetes dataset validated the correctness of our privacy-preserving
imputation methods, yielding the largest error around $3 \times 10^{-3}$,
closely matching plaintext methods. We also analyzed the scalability of our
methods to varying numbers of samples, showing their applicability to
real-world healthcare problems. Our analysis demonstrated that all our methods
scale linearly with the number of samples. Except for kNN, the runtime of all
our methods indicates that they can be utilized for large datasets.

    <title>Similarities and Differences between Machine Learning and Traditional
  Advanced Statistical Modeling in Healthcare Analytics</title>
    <summary>  Data scientists and statisticians are often at odds when determining the best
approach, machine learning or statistical modeling, to solve an analytics
challenge. However, machine learning and statistical modeling are more cousins
than adversaries on different sides of an analysis battleground. Choosing
between the two approaches or in some cases using both is based on the problem
to be solved and outcomes required as well as the data available for use and
circumstances of the analysis. Machine learning and statistical modeling are
complementary, based on similar mathematical principles, but simply using
different tools in an overall analytics knowledge base. Determining the
predominant approach should be based on the problem to be solved as well as
empirical evidence, such as size and completeness of the data, number of
variables, assumptions or lack thereof, and expected outcomes such as
predictions or causality. Good analysts and data scientists should be well
versed in both techniques and their proper application, thereby using the right
tool for the right project to achieve the desired results.

    <title>Classification Methods Based on Machine Learning for the Analysis of
  Fetal Health Data</title>
    <summary>  The persistent battle to decrease childhood mortality serves as a commonly
employed benchmark for gauging advancements in the field of medicine. Globally,
the under-5 mortality rate stands at approximately 5 million, with a
significant portion of these deaths being avoidable. Given the significance of
this problem, Machine learning-based techniques have emerged as a prominent
tool for assessing fetal health. In this work, we have analyzed the
classification performance of various machine learning models for fetal health
analysis. Classification performance of various machine learning models, such
as support vector machine (SVM), random forest(RF), and attentive interpretable
tabular learning (TabNet) have been assessed on fetal health. Moreover,
dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal component analysis (PCA)
and Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) have been implemented to obtain better
classification performance with less number of features. A TabNet model on a
fetal health dataset provides a classification accuracy of 94.36%. In general,
this technology empowers doctors and healthcare experts to achieve precise
fetal health classification and identify the most influential features in the
process.

    <title>Adversarial Attention for Human Motion Synthesis</title>
    <summary>  Analysing human motions is a core topic of interest for many disciplines,
from Human-Computer Interaction, to entertainment, Virtual Reality and
healthcare. Deep learning has achieved impressive results in capturing human
pose in real-time. On the other hand, due to high inter-subject variability,
human motion analysis models often suffer from not being able to generalise to
data from unseen subjects due to very limited specialised datasets available in
fields such as healthcare. However, acquiring human motion datasets is highly
time-consuming, challenging, and expensive. Hence, human motion synthesis is a
crucial research problem within deep learning and computer vision. We present a
novel method for controllable human motion synthesis by applying
attention-based probabilistic deep adversarial models with end-to-end training.
We show that we can generate synthetic human motion over both short- and
long-time horizons through the use of adversarial attention. Furthermore, we
show that we can improve the classification performance of deep learning models
in cases where there is inadequate real data, by supplementing existing
datasets with synthetic motions.

    <title>MetaFed: Federated Learning among Federations with Cyclic Knowledge
  Distillation for Personalized Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning has attracted increasing attention to building models
without accessing the raw user data, especially in healthcare. In real
applications, different federations can seldom work together due to possible
reasons such as data heterogeneity and distrust/inexistence of the central
server. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called MetaFed to
facilitate trustworthy FL between different federations. MetaFed obtains a
personalized model for each federation without a central server via the
proposed Cyclic Knowledge Distillation. Specifically, MetaFed treats each
federation as a meta distribution and aggregates knowledge of each federation
in a cyclic manner. The training is split into two parts: common knowledge
accumulation and personalization. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks
demonstrate that MetaFed without a server achieves better accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 10%+ accuracy improvement compared to the
baseline for PAMAP2) with fewer communication costs.

    <title>Time-aware Heterogeneous Graph Transformer with Adaptive Attention
  Merging for Health Event Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The widespread application of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data in the
medical field has led to early successes in disease risk prediction using deep
learning methods. These methods typically require extensive data for training
due to their large parameter sets. However, existing works do not exploit the
full potential of EHR data. A significant challenge arises from the infrequent
occurrence of many medical codes within EHR data, limiting their clinical
applicability. Current research often lacks in critical areas: 1) incorporating
disease domain knowledge; 2) heterogeneously learning disease representations
with rich meanings; 3) capturing the temporal dynamics of disease progression.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel heterogeneous graph
learning model designed to assimilate disease domain knowledge and elucidate
the intricate relationships between drugs and diseases. This model innovatively
incorporates temporal data into visit-level embeddings and leverages a
time-aware transformer alongside an adaptive attention mechanism to produce
patient representations. When evaluated on two healthcare datasets, our
approach demonstrated notable enhancements in both prediction accuracy and
interpretability over existing methodologies, signifying a substantial
advancement towards personalized and proactive healthcare management.

    <title>Testing Real-World Healthcare IoT Application: Experiences and Lessons
  Learned</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) applications require rigorous testing to
ensure their dependability. Such applications are typically integrated with
various third-party healthcare applications and medical devices through REST
APIs. This integrated network of healthcare IoT applications leads to REST APIs
with complicated and interdependent structures, thus creating a major challenge
for automated system-level testing. We report an industrial evaluation of a
state-of-the-art REST APIs testing approach (RESTest) on a real-world
healthcare IoT application. We analyze the effectiveness of RESTest's testing
strategies regarding REST APIs failures, faults in the application, and REST
API coverage, by experimenting with six REST APIs of 41 API endpoints of the
healthcare IoT application. Results show that several failures are discovered
in different REST APIs with ~56% coverage using RESTest. Moreover, nine
potential faults are identified. Using the evidence collected from the
experiments, we provide our experiences and lessons learned.

    <title>Uncertainty-Aware Boosted Ensembling in Multi-Modal Settings</title>
    <summary>  Reliability of machine learning (ML) systems is crucial in safety-critical
applications such as healthcare, and uncertainty estimation is a widely
researched method to highlight the confidence of ML systems in deployment.
Sequential and parallel ensemble techniques have shown improved performance of
ML systems in multi-modal settings by leveraging the feature sets together. We
propose an uncertainty-aware boosting technique for multi-modal ensembling in
order to focus on the data points with higher associated uncertainty estimates,
rather than the ones with higher loss values. We evaluate this method on
healthcare tasks related to Dementia and Parkinson's disease which involve
real-world multi-modal speech and text data, wherein our method shows an
improved performance. Additional analysis suggests that introducing
uncertainty-awareness into the boosted ensembles decreases the overall entropy
of the system, making it more robust to heteroscedasticity in the data, as well
as better calibrating each of the modalities along with high quality prediction
intervals. We open-source our entire codebase at

    <title>A Federated Cox Model with Non-Proportional Hazards</title>
    <summary>  Recent research has shown the potential for neural networks to improve upon
classical survival models such as the Cox model, which is widely used in
clinical practice. Neural networks, however, typically rely on data that are
centrally available, whereas healthcare data are frequently held in secure
silos. We present a federated Cox model that accommodates this data setting and
also relaxes the proportional hazards assumption, allowing time-varying
covariate effects. In this latter respect, our model does not require explicit
specification of the time-varying effects, reducing upfront organisational
costs compared to previous works. We experiment with publicly available
clinical datasets and demonstrate that the federated model is able to perform
as well as a standard model.

    <title>Reverse Survival Model (RSM): A Pipeline for Explaining Predictions of
  Deep Survival Models</title>
    <summary>  The aim of survival analysis in healthcare is to estimate the probability of
occurrence of an event, such as a patient's death in an intensive care unit
(ICU). Recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs) for survival analysis
show the superiority of these models in comparison with other well-known models
in survival analysis applications. Ensuring the reliability and explainability
of deep survival models deployed in healthcare is a necessity. Since DNN models
often behave like a black box, their predictions might not be easily trusted by
clinicians, especially when predictions are contrary to a physician's opinion.
A deep survival model that explains and justifies its decision-making process
could potentially gain the trust of clinicians. In this research, we propose
the reverse survival model (RSM) framework that provides detailed insights into
the decision-making process of survival models. For each patient of interest,
RSM can extract similar patients from a dataset and rank them based on the most
relevant features that deep survival models rely on for their predictions.

    <title>Counterfactual Reasoning for Fair Clinical Risk Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The use of machine learning systems to support decision making in healthcare
raises questions as to what extent these systems may introduce or exacerbate
disparities in care for historically underrepresented and mistreated groups,
due to biases implicitly embedded in observational data in electronic health
records. To address this problem in the context of clinical risk prediction
models, we develop an augmented counterfactual fairness criteria to extend the
group fairness criteria of equalized odds to an individual level. We do so by
requiring that the same prediction be made for a patient, and a counterfactual
patient resulting from changing a sensitive attribute, if the factual and
counterfactual outcomes do not differ. We investigate the extent to which the
augmented counterfactual fairness criteria may be applied to develop fair
models for prolonged inpatient length of stay and mortality with observational
electronic health records data. As the fairness criteria is ill-defined without
knowledge of the data generating process, we use a variational autoencoder to
perform counterfactual inference in the context of an assumed causal graph.
While our technique provides a means to trade off maintenance of fairness with
reduction in predictive performance in the context of a learned generative
model, further work is needed to assess the generality of this approach.

    <title>An Offline Time-aware Apprenticeship Learning Framework for Evolving
  Reward Functions</title>
    <summary>  Apprenticeship learning (AL) is a process of inducing effective
decision-making policies via observing and imitating experts' demonstrations.
Most existing AL approaches, however, are not designed to cope with the
evolving reward functions commonly found in human-centric tasks such as
healthcare, where offline learning is required. In this paper, we propose an
offline Time-aware Hierarchical EM Energy-based Sub-trajectory (THEMES) AL
framework to tackle the evolving reward functions in such tasks. The
effectiveness of THEMES is evaluated via a challenging task -- sepsis
treatment. The experimental results demonstrate that THEMES can significantly
outperform competitive state-of-the-art baselines.

    <title>A Framework for Predicting Impactability of Healthcare Interventions
  Using Machine Learning Methods, Administrative Claims, Sociodemographic and
  App Generated Data</title>
    <summary>  It is not clear how to target patients who are most likely to benefit from
digital care management programs ex-ante, a shortcoming of current risk score
based approaches. This study focuses on defining impactability by identifying
those patients most likely to benefit from technology enabled care management,
delivered through a digital health platform, including a mobile app and
clinician web dashboard. Anonymized insurance claims data were used from a
commercially insured population across several U.S. states and combined with
inferred sociodemographic data and data derived from the patient-held mobile
application itself. Our approach involves the creation of two models and the
comparative analysis of the methodologies and performances therein. We first
train a cost prediction model to calculate the differences in predicted
(without intervention) versus actual (with onboarding onto digital health
platform) healthcare expenditure for patients (N = 1,242). This enables the
classification of impactability if differences in predicted versus actual costs
meet a predetermined threshold. A random forest machine learning model was then
trained to accurately categorize new patients as impactable versus not
impactable, reaching an overall accuracy of 71.9%. We then modify these
parameters through grid search to define the parameters that deliver optimal
performance. A roadmap is proposed to iteratively improve the performance of
the model. As the number of newly onboarded patients and length of use
continues to increase, the accuracy of predicting impactability will improve
commensurately as more advanced machine learning techniques such as deep
learning become relevant. This approach is generalizable to analyzing the
impactability of any intervention and is a key component of realising closed
loop feedback systems for continuous improvement in healthcare.

    <title>Text-to-SQL Generation for Question Answering on Electronic Medical
  Records</title>
    <summary>  Electronic medical records (EMR) contain comprehensive patient information
and are typically stored in a relational database with multiple tables.
Effective and efficient patient information retrieval from EMR data is a
challenging task for medical experts. Question-to-SQL generation methods tackle
this problem by first predicting the SQL query for a given question about a
database, and then, executing the query on the database. However, most of the
existing approaches have not been adapted to the healthcare domain due to a
lack of healthcare Question-to-SQL dataset for learning models specific to this
domain. In addition, wide use of the abbreviation of terminologies and possible
typos in questions introduce additional challenges for accurately generating
the corresponding SQL queries. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by
developing a deep learning based TRanslate-Edit Model for Question-to-SQL
(TREQS) generation, which adapts the widely used sequence-to-sequence model to
directly generate the SQL query for a given question, and further performs the
required edits using an attentive-copying mechanism and task-specific look-up
tables. Based on the widely used publicly available electronic medical
database, we create a new large-scale Question-SQL pair dataset, named
MIMICSQL, in order to perform the Question-to-SQL generation task in healthcare
domain. An extensive set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the
performance of our proposed model on MIMICSQL. Both quantitative and
qualitative experimental results indicate the flexibility and efficiency of our
proposed method in predicting condition values and its robustness to random
questions with abbreviations and typos.

    <title>Multinomial belief networks for healthcare data</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data from patient or population cohorts are often characterized by
sparsity, high missingness and relatively small sample sizes. In addition,
being able to quantify uncertainty is often important in a medical context. To
address these analytical requirements we propose a deep generative Bayesian
model for multinomial count data. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampling
procedure that takes advantage of a series of augmentation relations, inspired
by the Zhou$\unicode{x2013}$Cong$\unicode{x2013}$Chen model. We visualise the
model's ability to identify coherent substructures in the data using a dataset
of handwritten digits. We then apply it to a large experimental dataset of DNA
mutations in cancer and show that we can identify biologically meaningful
clusters of mutational signatures in a fully data-driven way.

    <title>Improving confidence while predicting trends in temporal disease
  networks</title>
    <summary>  For highly sensitive real-world predictive analytic applications such as
healthcare and medicine, having good prediction accuracy alone is often not
enough. These kinds of applications require a decision making process which
uses uncertainty estimation as input whenever possible. Quality of uncertainty
estimation is a subject of over or under confident prediction, which is often
not addressed in many models. In this paper we show several extensions to the
Gaussian Conditional Random Fields model, which aim to provide higher quality
uncertainty estimation. These extensions are applied to the temporal disease
graph built from the State Inpatient Database (SID) of California, acquired
from the HCUP. Our experiments demonstrate benefits of using graph information
in modeling temporal disease properties as well as improvements in uncertainty
estimation provided by given extensions of the Gaussian Conditional Random
Fields method.

    <title>CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time
  Series Imputation</title>
    <summary>  The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in
healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for
time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed
existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as
image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series
imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models
for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes
score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing
score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained
for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On
healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing
probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition,
deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the
state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also
be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is
competitive with existing baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.

    <title>Quantifying Explainability in NLP and Analyzing Algorithms for
  Performance-Explainability Tradeoff</title>
    <summary>  The healthcare domain is one of the most exciting application areas for
machine learning, but a lack of model transparency contributes to a lag in
adoption within the industry. In this work, we explore the current art of
explainability and interpretability within a case study in clinical text
classification, using a task of mortality prediction within MIMIC-III clinical
notes. We demonstrate various visualization techniques for fully interpretable
methods as well as model-agnostic post hoc attributions, and we provide a
generalized method for evaluating the quality of explanations using infidelity
and local Lipschitz across model types from logistic regression to BERT
variants. With these metrics, we introduce a framework through which
practitioners and researchers can assess the frontier between a model's
predictive performance and the quality of its available explanations. We make
our code available to encourage continued refinement of these methods.

    <title>An Overview of Healthcare Data Analytics With Applications to the
  COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In the era of big data, standard analysis tools may be inadequate for making
inference and there is a growing need for more efficient and innovative ways to
collect, process, analyze and interpret the massive and complex data. We
provide an overview of challenges in big data problems and describe how
innovative analytical methods, machine learning tools and metaheuristics can
tackle general healthcare problems with a focus on the current pandemic. In
particular, we give applications of modern digital technology, statistical
methods, data platforms and data integration systems to improve diagnosis and
treatment of diseases in clinical research and novel epidemiologic tools to
tackle infection source problems, such as finding Patient Zero in the spread of
epidemics. We make the case that analyzing and interpreting big data is a very
challenging task that requires a multi-disciplinary effort to continuously
create more effective methodologies and powerful tools to transfer data
information into knowledge that enables informed decision making.

    <title>EXMOS: Explanatory Model Steering Through Multifaceted Explanations and
  Data Configurations</title>
    <summary>  Explanations in interactive machine-learning systems facilitate debugging and
improving prediction models. However, the effectiveness of various global
model-centric and data-centric explanations in aiding domain experts to detect
and resolve potential data issues for model improvement remains unexplored.
This research investigates the influence of data-centric and model-centric
global explanations in systems that support healthcare experts in optimising
models through automated and manual data configurations. We conducted
quantitative (n=70) and qualitative (n=30) studies with healthcare experts to
explore the impact of different explanations on trust, understandability and
model improvement. Our results reveal the insufficiency of global model-centric
explanations for guiding users during data configuration. Although data-centric
explanations enhanced understanding of post-configuration system changes, a
hybrid fusion of both explanation types demonstrated the highest effectiveness.
Based on our study results, we also present design implications for effective
explanation-driven interactive machine-learning systems.

    <title>Machine Learning with Electronic Health Records is vulnerable to
  Backdoor Trigger Attacks</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a wealth of information for machine
learning algorithms to predict the patient outcome from the data including
diagnostic information, vital signals, lab tests, drug administration, and
demographic information. Machine learning models can be built, for example, to
evaluate patients based on their predicted mortality or morbidity and to
predict required resources for efficient resource management in hospitals. In
this paper, we demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the machine learning
predictions with EHRs easily and selectively at test time by backdoor attacks
with the poisoned training data. Furthermore, the poison we create has
statistically similar features to the original data making it hard to detect,
and can also attack multiple machine learning models without any knowledge of
the models. With less than 5% of the raw EHR data poisoned, we achieve average
attack success rates of 97% on mortality prediction tasks with MIMIC-III
database against Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, and Long
Short-term Memory models simultaneously.

    <title>Predicting Post-Concussion Syndrome Outcomes with Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, machine learning models are used to predict outcomes for
patients with persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Patients had sustained
a concussion at an average of two to three months before the study. By
utilizing assessed data, the machine learning models aimed to predict whether
or not a patient would continue to have PCS after four to five months. The
random forest classifier achieved the highest performance with an 85% accuracy
and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94.
Factors found to be predictive of PCS outcome were Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD), perceived injustice, self-rated prognosis, and symptom
severity post-injury. The results of this study demonstrate that machine
learning models can predict PCS outcomes with high accuracy. With further
research, machine learning models may be implemented in healthcare settings to
help patients with persistent PCS.

    <title>Real-Time Pill Identification for the Visually Impaired Using Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  The prevalence of mobile technology offers unique opportunities for
addressing healthcare challenges, especially for individuals with visual
impairments. This paper explores the development and implementation of a deep
learning-based mobile application designed to assist blind and visually
impaired individuals in real-time pill identification. Utilizing the YOLO
framework, the application aims to accurately recognize and differentiate
between various pill types through real-time image processing on mobile
devices. The system incorporates Text-to- Speech (TTS) to provide immediate
auditory feedback, enhancing usability and independence for visually impaired
users. Our study evaluates the application's effectiveness in terms of
detection accuracy and user experience, highlighting its potential to improve
medication management and safety among the visually impaired community.

    <title>Conformalized density- and distance-based anomaly detection in
  time-series data</title>
    <summary>  Anomalies (unusual patterns) in time-series data give essential, and often
actionable information in critical situations. Examples can be found in such
fields as healthcare, intrusion detection, finance, security and flight safety.
In this paper we propose new conformalized density- and distance-based anomaly
detection algorithms for a one-dimensional time-series data. The algorithms use
a combination of a feature extraction method, an approach to assess a score
whether a new observation differs significantly from a previously observed
data, and a probabilistic interpretation of this score based on the conformal
paradigm.

    <title>Data-pooling Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Healthcare
  Intervention</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the emerging needs of personalized preventative intervention in
many healthcare applications, we consider a multi-stage, dynamic
decision-making problem in the online setting with unknown model parameters. To
deal with the pervasive issue of small sample size in personalized planning, we
develop a novel data-pooling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on a
general perturbed value iteration framework. Our algorithm adaptively pools
historical data, with three main innovations: (i) the weight of pooling ties
directly to the performance of decision (measured by regret) as opposed to
estimation accuracy in conventional methods; (ii) no parametric assumptions are
needed between historical and current data; and (iii) requiring data-sharing
only via aggregate statistics, as opposed to patient-level data. Our
data-pooling algorithm framework applies to a variety of popular RL algorithms,
and we establish a theoretical performance guarantee showing that our pooling
version achieves a regret bound strictly smaller than that of the no-pooling
counterpart. We substantiate the theoretical development with empirically
better performance of our algorithm via a case study in the context of
post-discharge intervention to prevent unplanned readmissions, generating
practical insights for healthcare management. In particular, our algorithm
alleviates privacy concerns about sharing health data, which (i) opens the door
for individual organizations to levering public datasets or published studies
to better manage their own patients; and (ii) provides the basis for public
policy makers to encourage organizations to share aggregate data to improve
population health outcomes for the broader community.

    <title>AI Driven Knowledge Extraction from Clinical Practice Guidelines:
  Turning Research into Practice</title>
    <summary>  Background and Objectives: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) represent the
foremost methodology for sharing state-of-the-art research findings in the
healthcare domain with medical practitioners to limit practice variations,
reduce clinical cost, improve the quality of care, and provide evidence based
treatment. However, extracting relevant knowledge from the plethora of CPGs is
not feasible for already burdened healthcare professionals, leading to large
gaps between clinical findings and real practices. It is therefore imperative
that state-of-the-art Computing research, especially machine learning is used
to provide artificial intelligence based solution for extracting the knowledge
from CPGs and reducing the gap between healthcare research/guidelines and
practice. Methods: This research presents a novel methodology for knowledge
extraction from CPGs to reduce the gap and turn the latest research findings
into clinical practice. First, our system classifies the CPG sentences into
four classes such as condition-action, condition-consequences, action, and
not-applicable based on the information presented in a sentence. We use deep
learning with state-of-the-art word embedding, improved word vectors technique
in classification process. Second, it identifies qualifier terms in the
classified sentences, which assist in recognizing the condition and action
phrases in a sentence. Finally, the condition and action phrase are processed
and transformed into plain rule If Condition(s) Then Action format. Results: We
evaluate the methodology on three different domains guidelines including
Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma. The deep learning model classifies
the CPG sentences with an accuracy of 95%. While rule extraction was validated
by user-centric approach, which achieved a Jaccard coefficient of 0.6, 0.7, and
0.4 with three human experts extracted rules, respectively.

    <title>COmic: Convolutional Kernel Networks for Interpretable End-to-End
  Learning on (Multi-)Omics Data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The size of available omics datasets is steadily increasing with
technological advancement in recent years. While this increase in sample size
can be used to improve the performance of relevant prediction tasks in
healthcare, models that are optimized for large datasets usually operate as
black boxes. In high stakes scenarios, like healthcare, using a black-box model
poses safety and security issues. Without an explanation about molecular
factors and phenotypes that affected the prediction, healthcare providers are
left with no choice but to blindly trust the models. We propose a new type of
artificial neural network, named Convolutional Omics Kernel Network (COmic). By
combining convolutional kernel networks with pathway-induced kernels, our
method enables robust and interpretable end-to-end learning on omics datasets
ranging in size from a few hundred to several hundreds of thousands of samples.
Furthermore, COmic can be easily adapted to utilize multi-omics data.
  Results: We evaluated the performance capabilities of COmic on six different
breast cancer cohorts. Additionally, we trained COmic models on multi-omics
data using the METABRIC cohort. Our models performed either better or similar
to competitors on both tasks. We show how the use of pathway-induced Laplacian
kernels opens the black-box nature of neural networks and results in
intrinsically interpretable models that eliminate the need for post-hoc
explanation models.

    <title>On the Impact of Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning Environments
  with Application to Healthcare Networks</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple privacy-sensitive applications to
leverage their dataset for a global model construction without any disclosure
of the information. One of those domains is healthcare, where groups of silos
collaborate in order to generate a global predictor with improved accuracy and
generalization. However, the inherent challenge lies in the high heterogeneity
of medical data, necessitating sophisticated techniques for assessment and
compensation. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the
mathematical formalization and taxonomy of heterogeneity within FL
environments, focusing on the intricacies of medical data. In particular, we
address the evaluation and comparison of the most popular FL algorithms with
respect to their ability to cope with quantity-based, feature and label
distribution-based heterogeneity. The goal is to provide a quantitative
evaluation of the impact of data heterogeneity in FL systems for healthcare
networks as well as a guideline on FL algorithm selection. Our research extends
beyond existing studies by benchmarking seven of the most common FL algorithms
against the unique challenges posed by medical data use cases. The paper
targets the prediction of the risk of stroke recurrence through a set of
tabular clinical reports collected by different federated hospital silos: data
heterogeneity frequently encountered in this scenario and its impact on FL
performance are discussed.

    <title>Mimic: An adaptive algorithm for multivariate time series classification</title>
    <summary>  Time series data are valuable but are often inscrutable. Gaining trust in
time series classifiers for finance, healthcare, and other critical
applications may rely on creating interpretable models. Researchers have
previously been forced to decide between interpretable methods that lack
predictive power and deep learning methods that lack transparency. In this
paper, we propose a novel Mimic algorithm that retains the predictive accuracy
of the strongest classifiers while introducing interpretability. Mimic mirrors
the learning method of an existing multivariate time series classifier while
simultaneously producing a visual representation that enhances user
understanding of the learned model. Experiments on 26 time series datasets
support Mimic's ability to imitate a variety of time series classifiers
visually and accurately.

    <title>Embedded Deep Learning for Sleep Staging</title>
    <summary>  The rapidly-advancing technology of deep learning (DL) into the world of the
Internet of Things (IoT) has not fully entered in the fields of m-Health yet.
Among the main reasons are the high computational demands of DL algorithms and
the inherent resource-limitation of wearable devices. In this paper, we present
initial results for two deep learning architectures used to diagnose and
analyze sleep patterns, and we compare them with a previously presented
hand-crafted algorithm. The algorithms are designed to be reliable for consumer
healthcare applications and to be integrated into low-power wearables with
limited computational resources.

    <title>TF-IDF vs Word Embeddings for Morbidity Identification in Clinical
  Notes: An Initial Study</title>
    <summary>  Today, we are seeing an ever-increasing number of clinical notes that contain
clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient's health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.

    <title>Contextual Care Protocol using Neural Networks and Decision Trees</title>
    <summary>  A contextual care protocol is used by a medical practitioner for patient
healthcare, given the context or situation that the specified patient is in.
This paper proposes a method to build an automated self-adapting protocol which
can help make relevant, early decisions for effective healthcare delivery. The
hybrid model leverages neural networks and decision trees. The neural network
estimates the chances of each disease and each tree in the decision trees
represents care protocol for a disease. These trees are subject to change in
case of aberrations found by the diagnosticians. These corrections or
prediction errors are clustered into similar groups for scalability and review
by the experts. The corrections as suggested by the experts are incorporated
into the model.

    <title>Distinguishing Engagement Facets: An Essential Component for AI-based
  Interactive Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Engagement in Human-Machine Interaction is the process by which entities
participating in the interaction establish, maintain, and end their perceived
connection. It is essential to monitor the engagement state of patients in
various AI-based interactive healthcare paradigms. This includes medical
conditions that alter social behavior such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Engagement is a multi-faceted
construct which is composed of behavioral, emotional, and mental components.
Previous research has neglected this multi-faceted nature of engagement and
focused on the detection of engagement level or binary engagement label. In
this paper, a system is presented to distinguish these facets using contextual
and relational features. This can facilitate further fine-grained analysis.
Several machine learning classifiers including traditional and deep learning
models are compared for this task. An F-Score of 0.74 was obtained on a
balanced dataset of 22242 instances with neural network-based classification.
The proposed framework shall serve as a baseline for further research on
engagement facets recognition, and its integration is socially assistive
robotic applications.

    <title>Representational Ethical Model Calibration</title>
    <summary>  Equity is widely held to be fundamental to the ethics of healthcare. In the
context of clinical decision-making, it rests on the comparative fidelity of
the intelligence -- evidence-based or intuitive -- guiding the management of
each individual patient. Though brought to recent attention by the
individuating power of contemporary machine learning, such epistemic equity
arises in the context of any decision guidance, whether traditional or
innovative. Yet no general framework for its quantification, let alone
assurance, currently exists. Here we formulate epistemic equity in terms of
model fidelity evaluated over learnt multi-dimensional representations of
identity crafted to maximise the captured diversity of the population,
introducing a comprehensive framework for Representational Ethical Model
Calibration. We demonstrate use of the framework on large-scale multimodal data
from UK Biobank to derive diverse representations of the population, quantify
model performance, and institute responsive remediation. We offer our approach
as a principled solution to quantifying and assuring epistemic equity in
healthcare, with applications across the research, clinical, and regulatory
domains.

    <title>CEHR-GPT: Generating Electronic Health Records with Chronological
  Patient Timelines</title>
    <summary>  Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) have emerged as a pivotal tool in
advancing healthcare applications and machine learning models, particularly for
researchers without direct access to healthcare data. Although existing
methods, like rule-based approaches and generative adversarial networks (GANs),
generate synthetic data that resembles real-world EHR data, these methods often
use a tabular format, disregarding temporal dependencies in patient histories
and limiting data replication. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for EHR data. This enables
applications like disease progression analysis, population estimation,
counterfactual reasoning, and synthetic data generation. In this work, we focus
on synthetic data generation and demonstrate the capability of training a GPT
model using a particular patient representation derived from CEHR-BERT,
enabling us to generate patient sequences that can be seamlessly converted to
the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data format.

    <title>OPERA: Automatic Offline Policy Evaluation with Re-weighted Aggregates
  of Multiple Estimators</title>
    <summary>  Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new
sequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical
interaction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online
without a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or
hazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE
estimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have
hyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE
algorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose
a new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset
without relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We
prove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable
properties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when
compared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select
higher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to
improving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy
evaluation framework for offline RL.

    <title>Multiple Instance Learning for ECG Risk Stratification</title>
    <summary>  Patients who suffer an acute coronary syndrome are at elevated risk for
adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and cardiovascular
death. Accurate assessment of this risk is crucial to their course of care. We
focus on estimating a patient's risk of cardiovascular death after an acute
coronary syndrome based on a patient's raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.
Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples
signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class
imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of
heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome. Machine
learning has been previously applied to this task, but most approaches rely on
hand-crafted features and domain knowledge. We propose a method that learns a
representation from the raw ECG signal by using a multiple instance learning
framework. We present a learned risk score for cardiovascular death that
outperforms existing risk metrics in predicting cardiovascular death within 30,
60, 90, and 365 days on a dataset of 5000 patients.

    <title>Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical Systems applied to Physiological
  Condition Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  We present a non-linear dynamical system for modelling the effect of drug
infusions on the vital signs of patients admitted in Intensive Care Units
(ICUs). More specifically we are interested in modelling the effect of a widely
used anaesthetic drug (Propofol) on a patient's monitored depth of anaesthesia
and haemodynamics. We compare our approach with one from the
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) literature and show that we can
provide significant improvements in performance without requiring the
incorporation of expert physiological knowledge in our system.

    <title>The Security of Deep Learning Defences for Medical Imaging</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning has shown great promise in the domain of medical image
analysis. Medical professionals and healthcare providers have been adopting the
technology to speed up and enhance their work. These systems use deep neural
networks (DNN) which are vulnerable to adversarial samples; images with
imperceivable changes that can alter the model's prediction. Researchers have
proposed defences which either make a DNN more robust or detect the adversarial
samples before they do harm. However, none of these works consider an informed
attacker which can adapt to the defence mechanism. We show that an informed
attacker can evade five of the current state of the art defences while
successfully fooling the victim's deep learning model, rendering these defences
useless. We then suggest better alternatives for securing healthcare DNNs from
such attacks: (1) harden the system's security and (2) use digital signatures.

    <title>Substra: a framework for privacy-preserving, traceable and collaborative
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning is promising, but it often needs to process vast amounts of
sensitive data which raises concerns about privacy. In this white-paper, we
introduce Substra, a distributed framework for privacy-preserving, traceable
and collaborative Machine Learning. Substra gathers data providers and
algorithm designers into a network of nodes that can train models on demand but
under advanced permission regimes. To guarantee data privacy, Substra
implements distributed learning: the data never leave their nodes; only
algorithms, predictive models and non-sensitive metadata are exchanged on the
network. The computations are orchestrated by a Distributed Ledger Technology
which guarantees traceability and authenticity of information without needing
to trust a third party. Although originally developed for Healthcare
applications, Substra is not data, algorithm or programming language specific.
It supports many types of computation plans including parallel computation plan
commonly used in Federated Learning. With appropriate guidelines, it can be
deployed for numerous Machine Learning use-cases with data or algorithm
providers where trust is limited.

    <title>Learning Hidden Patterns from Patient Multivariate Time Series Data
  Using Convolutional Neural Networks: A Case Study of Healthcare Cost
  Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To develop an effective and scalable individual-level patient cost
prediction method by automatically learning hidden temporal patterns from
multivariate time series data in patient insurance claims using a convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture.
  Methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to
2016 from a healthcare insurer, where data from the first two years were used
to build the model to predict costs in the third year. The data consisted of
the multivariate time series of cost, visit and medical features that were
shaped as images of patients' health status (i.e., matrices with time windows
on one dimension and the medical, visit and cost features on the other
dimension). Patients' multivariate time series images were given to a CNN
method with a proposed architecture. After hyper-parameter tuning, the proposed
architecture consisted of three building blocks of convolution and pooling
layers with an LReLU activation function and a customized kernel size at each
layer for healthcare data. The proposed CNN learned temporal patterns became
inputs to a fully connected layer.
  Conclusions: Feature learning through the proposed CNN configuration
significantly improved individual-level healthcare cost prediction. The
proposed CNN was able to outperform temporal pattern detection methods that
look for a pre-defined set of pattern shapes, since it is capable of extracting
a variable number of patterns with various shapes. Temporal patterns learned
from medical, visit and cost data made significant contributions to the
prediction performance. Hyper-parameter tuning showed that considering
three-month data patterns has the highest prediction accuracy. Our results
showed that patients' images extracted from multivariate time series data are
different from regular images, and hence require unique designs of CNN
architectures.

    <title>Deep Learning in Healthcare: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) along with never-ending advancements in computational
processing and cloud technologies have bestowed us powerful analyzing tools and
techniques in the past decade and enabled us to use and apply them in various
fields of study. Health informatics is not an exception, and conversely, is the
discipline that generates the most amount of data in today's era and can
benefit from DL the most. Extracting features and finding complex patterns from
a huge amount of raw data and transforming them into knowledge is a challenging
task. Besides, various DL architectures have been proposed by researchers
throughout the years to tackle different problems. In this paper, we provide a
review of DL models and their broad application in bioinformatics and
healthcare categorized by their architecture. In addition, we also go over some
of the key challenges that still exist and can show up while conducting DL
research.

    <title>Extracting information from free text through unsupervised graph-based
  clustering: an application to patient incident records</title>
    <summary>  The large volume of text in electronic healthcare records often remains
underused due to a lack of methodologies to extract interpretable content. Here
we present an unsupervised framework for the analysis of free text that
combines text-embedding with paragraph vectors and graph-theoretical multiscale
community detection. We analyse text from a corpus of patient incident reports
from the National Health Service in England to find content-based clusters of
reports in an unsupervised manner and at different levels of resolution. Our
unsupervised method extracts groups with high intrinsic textual consistency and
compares well against categories hand-coded by healthcare personnel. We also
show how to use our content-driven clusters to improve the supervised
prediction of the degree of harm of the incident based on the text of the
report. Finally, we discuss future directions to monitor reports over time, and
to detect emerging trends outside pre-existing categories.

    <title>Off-policy Policy Evaluation For Sequential Decisions Under Unobserved
  Confounding</title>
    <summary>  When observed decisions depend only on observed features, off-policy policy
evaluation (OPE) methods for sequential decision making problems can estimate
the performance of evaluation policies before deploying them. This assumption
is frequently violated due to unobserved confounders, unrecorded variables that
impact both the decisions and their outcomes. We assess robustness of OPE
methods under unobserved confounding by developing worst-case bounds on the
performance of an evaluation policy. When unobserved confounders can affect
every decision in an episode, we demonstrate that even small amounts of
per-decision confounding can heavily bias OPE methods. Fortunately, in a number
of important settings found in healthcare, policy-making, operations, and
technology, unobserved confounders may primarily affect only one of the many
decisions made. Under this less pessimistic model of one-decision confounding,
we propose an efficient loss-minimization-based procedure for computing
worst-case bounds, and prove its statistical consistency. On two simulated
healthcare examples---management of sepsis patients and developmental
interventions for autistic children---where this is a reasonable model of
confounding, we demonstrate that our method invalidates non-robust results and
provides meaningful certificates of robustness, allowing reliable selection of
policies even under unobserved confounding.

    <title>(Un)reasonable Allure of Ante-hoc Interpretability for High-stakes
  Domains: Transparency Is Necessary but Insufficient for Comprehensibility</title>
    <summary>  Ante-hoc interpretability has become the holy grail of explainable artificial
intelligence for high-stakes domains such as healthcare; however, this notion
is elusive, lacks a widely-accepted definition and depends on the operational
context. It can refer to predictive models whose structure adheres to
domain-specific constraints, or ones that are inherently transparent. The
latter conceptualisation assumes observers who judge this quality, whereas the
former presupposes them to have technical and domain expertise (thus alienating
other groups of explainees). Additionally, the distinction between ante-hoc
interpretability and the less desirable post-hoc explainability, which refers
to methods that construct a separate explanatory model, is vague given that
transparent predictive models may still require (post-)processing to yield
suitable explanatory insights. Ante-hoc interpretability is thus an overloaded
concept that comprises a range of implicit properties, which we unpack in this
paper to better understand what is needed for its safe adoption across
high-stakes domains. To this end, we outline modelling and explaining
desiderata that allow us to navigate its distinct realisations in view of the
envisaged application and audience.

    <title>Robust Aggregation for Adaptive Privacy Preserving Federated Learning in
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) has enabled training models collaboratively from
multiple data owning parties without sharing their data. Given the privacy
regulations of patient's healthcare data, learning-based systems in healthcare
can greatly benefit from privacy-preserving FL approaches. However, typical
model aggregation methods in FL are sensitive to local model updates, which may
lead to failure in learning a robust and accurate global model. In this work,
we implement and evaluate different robust aggregation methods in FL applied to
healthcare data. Furthermore, we show that such methods can detect and discard
faulty or malicious local clients during training. We run two sets of
experiments using two real-world healthcare datasets for training medical
diagnosis classification tasks. Each dataset is used to simulate the
performance of three different robust FL aggregation strategies when facing
different poisoning attacks. The results show that privacy preserving methods
can be successfully applied alongside Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques.
We observed in particular how using differential privacy (DP) did not
significantly impact the final learning convergence of the different
aggregation strategies.

    <title>Development and Validation of ML-DQA -- a Machine Learning Data Quality
  Assurance Framework for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The approaches by which the machine learning and clinical research
communities utilize real world data (RWD), including data captured in the
electronic health record (EHR), vary dramatically. While clinical researchers
cautiously use RWD for clinical investigations, ML for healthcare teams consume
public datasets with minimal scrutiny to develop new algorithms. This study
bridges this gap by developing and validating ML-DQA, a data quality assurance
framework grounded in RWD best practices. The ML-DQA framework is applied to
five ML projects across two geographies, different medical conditions, and
different cohorts. A total of 2,999 quality checks and 24 quality reports were
generated on RWD gathered on 247,536 patients across the five projects. Five
generalizable practices emerge: all projects used a similar method to group
redundant data element representations; all projects used automated utilities
to build diagnosis and medication data elements; all projects used a common
library of rules-based transformations; all projects used a unified approach to
assign data quality checks to data elements; and all projects used a similar
approach to clinical adjudication. An average of 5.8 individuals, including
clinicians, data scientists, and trainees, were involved in implementing ML-DQA
for each project and an average of 23.4 data elements per project were either
transformed or removed in response to ML-DQA. This study demonstrates the
importance role of ML-DQA in healthcare projects and provides teams a framework
to conduct these essential activities.

    <title>The Scope of In-Context Learning for the Extraction of Medical Temporal
  Constraints</title>
    <summary>  Medications often impose temporal constraints on everyday patient activity.
Violations of such medical temporal constraints (MTCs) lead to a lack of
treatment adherence, in addition to poor health outcomes and increased
healthcare expenses. These MTCs are found in drug usage guidelines (DUGs) in
both patient education materials and clinical texts. Computationally
representing MTCs in DUGs will advance patient-centric healthcare applications
by helping to define safe patient activity patterns. We define a novel taxonomy
of MTCs found in DUGs and develop a novel context-free grammar (CFG) based
model to computationally represent MTCs from unstructured DUGs. Additionally,
we release three new datasets with a combined total of N = 836 DUGs labeled
with normalized MTCs. We develop an in-context learning (ICL) solution for
automatically extracting and normalizing MTCs found in DUGs, achieving an
average F1 score of 0.62 across all datasets. Finally, we rigorously
investigate ICL model performance against a baseline model, across datasets and
MTC types, and through in-depth error analysis.

    <title>Artificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical
  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach</title>
    <summary>  In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the
growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized
medicine.

    <title>Point-of-Care Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis: A Standalone Mobile
  Application Approach</title>
    <summary>  Although deep learning research and applications have grown rapidly over the
past decade, it has shown limitation in healthcare applications and its
reachability to people in remote areas. One of the challenges of incorporating
deep learning in medical data classification or prediction is the shortage of
annotated training data in the healthcare industry. Medical data sharing
privacy issues and limited patient population size can be stated as some of the
reasons for training data insufficiency in healthcare. Methods to exploit deep
learning applications in healthcare have been proposed and implemented in this
dissertation.
  Traditional diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy requires trained
ophthalmologists and expensive imaging equipment to reach healthcare centres in
order to provide facilities for treatment of preventable blindness. Diabetic
people residing in remote areas with shortage of healthcare services and
ophthalmologists usually fail to get periodical diagnosis of diabetic
retinopathy thereby facing the probability of vision loss or impairment. Deep
learning and mobile application development have been integrated in this
dissertation to provide an easy to use point-of-care smartphone based diagnosis
of diabetic retinopathy. In order to solve the challenge of shortage of
healthcare centres and trained ophthalmologists, the standalone diagnostic
service was built so as to be operated by a non-expert without an internet
connection. This approach could be transferred to other areas of medical image
classification.

    <title>A hybrid model for predicting human physical activity status from
  lifelogging data</title>
    <summary>  One trend in the recent healthcare transformations is people are encouraged
to monitor and manage their health based on their daily diets and physical
activity habits. However, much attention of the use of operational research and
analytical models in healthcare has been paid to the systematic level such as
country or regional policy making or organisational issues. This paper proposes
a model concerned with healthcare analytics at the individual level, which can
predict human physical activity status from sequential lifelogging data
collected from wearable sensors. The model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in
short, MOGP-HMM) -- a multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) algorithm in
the first stage to reduce the dimensions of lifelogging data and a hidden
Markov model (HMM) in the second stage for activity status prediction over
time. It can be used as a decision support tool to provide real-time
monitoring, statistical analysis and personalized advice to individuals,
encouraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. We validate the
model with the real data collected from a group of participants in the UK, and
compare it with other popular two-stage hybrid models. Our experimental results
show that the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the very first study that uses the MOGP in the hybrid
two-stage structure for individuals' activity status prediction. It fits
seamlessly with the current trend in the UK healthcare transformation of
patient empowerment as well as contributing to a strategic development for more
efficient and cost-effective provision of healthcare.

    <title>Image Classification with Consistent Supporting Evidence</title>
    <summary>  Adoption of machine learning models in healthcare requires end users' trust
in the system. Models that provide additional supportive evidence for their
predictions promise to facilitate adoption. We define consistent evidence to be
both compatible and sufficient with respect to model predictions. We propose
measures of model inconsistency and regularizers that promote more consistent
evidence. We demonstrate our ideas in the context of edema severity grading
from chest radiographs. We demonstrate empirically that consistent models
provide competitive performance while supporting interpretation.

    <title>Is Task-Agnostic Explainable AI a Myth?</title>
    <summary>  Our work serves as a framework for unifying the challenges of contemporary
explainable AI (XAI). We demonstrate that while XAI methods provide
supplementary and potentially useful output for machine learning models,
researchers and decision-makers should be mindful of their conceptual and
technical limitations, which frequently result in these methods themselves
becoming black boxes. We examine three XAI research avenues spanning image,
textual, and graph data, covering saliency, attention, and graph-type
explainers. Despite the varying contexts and timeframes of the mentioned cases,
the same persistent roadblocks emerge, highlighting the need for a conceptual
breakthrough in the field to address the challenge of compatibility between XAI
methods and application tasks.

    <title>An Empirical Characterization of Fair Machine Learning For Clinical Risk
  Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The use of machine learning to guide clinical decision making has the
potential to worsen existing health disparities. Several recent works frame the
problem as that of algorithmic fairness, a framework that has attracted
considerable attention and criticism. However, the appropriateness of this
framework is unclear due to both ethical as well as technical considerations,
the latter of which include trade-offs between measures of fairness and model
performance that are not well-understood for predictive models of clinical
outcomes. To inform the ongoing debate, we conduct an empirical study to
characterize the impact of penalizing group fairness violations on an array of
measures of model performance and group fairness. We repeat the analyses across
multiple observational healthcare databases, clinical outcomes, and sensitive
attributes. We find that procedures that penalize differences between the
distributions of predictions across groups induce nearly-universal degradation
of multiple performance metrics within groups. On examining the secondary
impact of these procedures, we observe heterogeneity of the effect of these
procedures on measures of fairness in calibration and ranking across
experimental conditions. Beyond the reported trade-offs, we emphasize that
analyses of algorithmic fairness in healthcare lack the contextual grounding
and causal awareness necessary to reason about the mechanisms that lead to
health disparities, as well as about the potential of algorithmic fairness
methods to counteract those mechanisms. In light of these limitations, we
encourage researchers building predictive models for clinical use to step
outside the algorithmic fairness frame and engage critically with the broader
sociotechnical context surrounding the use of machine learning in healthcare.

    <title>MemoryCompanion: A Smart Healthcare Solution to Empower Efficient
  Alzheimer's Care Via Unleashing Generative AI</title>
    <summary>  With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably characterized by GPT
frameworks, there emerges a catalyst for novel healthcare applications. Earlier
iterations of chatbot caregivers, though existent, have yet to achieve a
dimension of human-like authenticity. This paper unveils `MemoryCompanion' a
pioneering digital health solution explicitly tailored for Alzheimer's disease
(AD) patients and their caregivers. Drawing upon the nuances of GPT technology
and prompt engineering, MemoryCompanion manifests a personalized caregiving
paradigm, fostering interactions via voice-cloning and talking-face mechanisms
that resonate with the familiarity of known companions. Using advanced
prompt-engineering, the system intricately adapts to each patient's distinct
profile, curating its content and communication style accordingly. This
approach strives to counteract prevalent issues of social isolation and
loneliness frequently observed in AD demographics. Our methodology, grounded in
its innovative design, addresses both the caregiving and technological
challenges intrinsic to this domain.

    <title>Patient Clustering Improves Efficiency of Federated Machine Learning to
  predict mortality and hospital stay time using distributed Electronic Medical
  Records</title>
    <summary>  Electronic medical records (EMRs) supports the development of machine
learning algorithms for predicting disease incidence, patient response to
treatment, and other healthcare events. But insofar most algorithms have been
centralized, taking little account of the decentralized, non-identically
independently distributed (non-IID), and privacy-sensitive characteristics of
EMRs that can complicate data collection, sharing and learning. To address this
challenge, we introduced a community-based federated machine learning (CBFL)
algorithm and evaluated it on non-IID ICU EMRs. Our algorithm clustered the
distributed data into clinically meaningful communities that captured similar
diagnoses and geological locations, and learnt one model for each community.
Throughout the learning process, the data was kept local on hospitals, while
locally-computed results were aggregated on a server. Evaluation results show
that CBFL outperformed the baseline FL algorithm in terms of Area Under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), Area Under the
Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC), and communication cost between hospitals and
the server. Furthermore, communities' performance difference could be explained
by how dissimilar one community was to others.

    <title>Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Edge computing and distributed machine learning have advanced to a level that
can revolutionize a particular organization. Distributed devices such as the
Internet of Things (IoT) often produce a large amount of data, eventually
resulting in big data that can be vital in uncovering hidden patterns, and
other insights in numerous fields such as healthcare, banking, and policing.
Data related to areas such as healthcare and banking can contain potentially
sensitive data that can become public if they are not appropriately sanitized.
Federated learning (FedML) is a recently developed distributed machine learning
(DML) approach that tries to preserve privacy by bringing the learning of an ML
model to data owners'. However, literature shows different attack methods such
as membership inference that exploit the vulnerabilities of ML models as well
as the coordinating servers to retrieve private data. Hence, FedML needs
additional measures to guarantee data privacy. Furthermore, big data often
requires more resources than available in a standard computer. This paper
addresses these issues by proposing a distributed perturbation algorithm named
as DISTPAB, for privacy preservation of horizontally partitioned data. DISTPAB
alleviates computational bottlenecks by distributing the task of privacy
preservation utilizing the asymmetry of resources of a distributed environment,
which can have resource-constrained devices as well as high-performance
computers. Experiments show that DISTPAB provides high accuracy, high
efficiency, high scalability, and high attack resistance. Further experiments
on privacy-preserving FedML show that DISTPAB is an excellent solution to stop
privacy leaks in DML while preserving high data utility.

    <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defences for Skin Cancer Classification</title>
    <summary>  There has been a concurrent significant improvement in the medical images
used to facilitate diagnosis and the performance of machine learning techniques
to perform tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation in recent
years. As a result, a rapid increase in the usage of such systems can be
observed in the healthcare industry, for instance in the form of medical image
classification systems, where these models have achieved diagnostic parity with
human physicians. One such application where this can be observed is in
computer vision tasks such as the classification of skin lesions in
dermatoscopic images. However, as stakeholders in the healthcare industry, such
as insurance companies, continue to invest extensively in machine learning
infrastructure, it becomes increasingly important to understand the
vulnerabilities in such systems. Due to the highly critical nature of the tasks
being carried out by these machine learning models, it is necessary to analyze
techniques that could be used to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and
methods to defend against them. This paper explores common adversarial attack
techniques. The Fast Sign Gradient Method and Projected Descent Gradient are
used against a Convolutional Neural Network trained to classify dermatoscopic
images of skin lesions. Following that, it also discusses one of the most
popular adversarial defense techniques, adversarial training. The performance
of the model that has been trained on adversarial examples is then tested
against the previously mentioned attacks, and recommendations to improve neural
networks robustness are thus provided based on the results of the experiment.

    <title>Ensemble learning with Conformal Predictors: Targeting credible
  predictions of conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's
  Disease</title>
    <summary>  Most machine learning classifiers give predictions for new examples
accurately, yet without indicating how trustworthy predictions are. In the
medical domain, this hampers their integration in decision support systems,
which could be useful in the clinical practice. We use a supervised learning
approach that combines Ensemble learning with Conformal Predictors to predict
conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease. Our goal is
to enhance the classification performance (Ensemble learning) and complement
each prediction with a measure of credibility (Conformal Predictors). Our
results showed the superiority of the proposed approach over a similar ensemble
framework with standard classifiers.

    <title>COVID-19 Imaging Data Privacy by Federated Learning Design: A
  Theoretical Framework</title>
    <summary>  To address COVID-19 healthcare challenges, we need frequent sharing of health
data, knowledge and resources at a global scale. However, in this digital age,
data privacy is a big concern that requires the secure embedding of privacy
assurance into the design of all technological solutions that use health data.
In this paper, we introduce differential privacy by design (dPbD) framework and
discuss its embedding into the federated machine learning system. To limit the
scope of our paper, we focus on the problem scenario of COVID-19 imaging data
privacy for disease diagnosis by computer vision and deep learning approaches.
We discuss the evaluation of the proposed design of federated machine learning
systems and discuss how differential privacy by design (dPbD) framework can
enhance data privacy in federated learning systems with scalability and
robustness. We argue that scalable differentially private federated learning
design is a promising solution for building a secure, private and collaborative
machine learning model such as required to combat COVID19 challenge.

    <title>Lightweight Mobile Automated Assistant-to-physician for Global
  Lower-resource Areas</title>
    <summary>  Importance: Lower-resource areas in Africa and Asia face a unique set of
healthcare challenges: the dual high burden of communicable and
non-communicable diseases; a paucity of highly trained primary healthcare
providers in both rural and densely populated urban areas; and a lack of
reliable, inexpensive internet connections. Objective: To address these
challenges, we designed an artificial intelligence assistant to help primary
healthcare providers in lower-resource areas document demographic and medical
sign/symptom data and to record and share diagnostic data in real-time with a
centralized database. Design: We trained our system using multiple data sets,
including US-based electronic medical records (EMRs) and open-source medical
literature and developed an adaptive, general medical assistant system based on
machine learning algorithms. Main outcomes and Measure: The application
collects basic information from patients and provides primary care providers
with diagnoses and prescriptions suggestions. The application is unique from
existing systems in that it covers a wide range of common diseases, signs, and
medication typical in lower-resource countries; the application works with or
without an active internet connection. Results: We have built and implemented
an adaptive learning system that assists trained primary care professionals by
means of an Android smartphone application, which interacts with a central
database and collects real-time data. The application has been tested by dozens
of primary care providers. Conclusions and Relevance: Our application would
provide primary healthcare providers in lower-resource areas with a tool that
enables faster and more accurate documentation of medical encounters. This
application could be leveraged to automatically populate local or national EMR
systems.

    <title>Towards Deep Learning Models for Psychological State Prediction using
  Smartphone Data: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
    <summary>  There is an increasing interest in exploiting mobile sensing technologies and
machine learning techniques for mental health monitoring and intervention.
Researchers have effectively used contextual information, such as mobility,
communication and mobile phone usage patterns for quantifying individuals' mood
and wellbeing. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of neural
network models for predicting users' level of stress by using the location
information collected by smartphones. We characterize the mobility patterns of
individuals using the GPS metrics presented in the literature and employ these
metrics as input to the network. We evaluate our approach on the open-source
StudentLife dataset. Moreover, we discuss the challenges and trade-offs
involved in building machine learning models for digital mental health and
highlight potential future work in this direction.

    <title>Coping with Mistreatment in Fair Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning actively impacts our everyday life in almost all endeavors
and domains such as healthcare, finance, and energy. As our dependence on the
machine learning increases, it is inevitable that these algorithms will be used
to make decisions that will have a direct impact on the society spanning all
resolutions from personal choices to world-wide policies. Hence, it is crucial
to ensure that (un)intentional bias does not affect the machine learning
algorithms especially when they are required to take decisions that may have
unintended consequences. Algorithmic fairness techniques have found traction in
the machine learning community and many methods and metrics have been proposed
to ensure and evaluate fairness in algorithms and data collection.
  In this paper, we study the algorithmic fairness in a supervised learning
setting and examine the effect of optimizing a classifier for the Equal
Opportunity metric. We demonstrate that such a classifier has an increased
false positive rate across sensitive groups and propose a conceptually simple
method to mitigate this bias. We rigorously analyze the proposed method and
evaluate it on several real world datasets demonstrating its efficacy.

    <title>PIKS: A Technique to Identify Actionable Trends for Policy-Makers
  Through Open Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  With calls for increasing transparency, governments are releasing greater
amounts of data in multiple domains including finance, education and
healthcare. The efficient exploratory analysis of healthcare data constitutes a
significant challenge. Key concerns in public health include the quick
identification and analysis of trends, and the detection of outliers. This
allows policies to be rapidly adapted to changing circumstances. We present an
efficient outlier detection technique, termed PIKS (Pruned iterative-k means
searchlight), which combines an iterative k-means algorithm with a pruned
searchlight based scan. We apply this technique to identify outliers in two
publicly available healthcare datasets from the New York Statewide Planning and
Research Cooperative System, and California's Office of Statewide Health
Planning and Development. We provide a comparison of our technique with three
other existing outlier detection techniques, consisting of auto-encoders,
isolation forests and feature bagging. We identified outliers in conditions
including suicide rates, immunity disorders, social admissions,
cardiomyopathies, and pregnancy in the third trimester. We demonstrate that the
PIKS technique produces results consistent with other techniques such as the
auto-encoder. However, the auto-encoder needs to be trained, which requires
several parameters to be tuned. In comparison, the PIKS technique has far fewer
parameters to tune. This makes it advantageous for fast, "out-of-the-box" data
exploration. The PIKS technique is scalable and can readily ingest new
datasets. Hence, it can provide valuable, up-to-date insights to citizens,
patients and policy-makers. We have made our code open source, and with the
availability of open data, other researchers can easily reproduce and extend
our work. This will help promote a deeper understanding of healthcare policies
and public health issues.

    <title>Refining Adverse Drug Reactions using Association Rule Mining for
  Electronic Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Side effects of prescribed medications are a common occurrence. Electronic
healthcare databases present the opportunity to identify new side effects
efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i.e. when
an association between two variables is identified due to them both being
associated to a third variable).
  In this paper we propose a proof of concept method that learns common
associations and uses this knowledge to automatically refine side effect
signals (i.e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the
exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the
signal instances that are most likely to correspond to true side effect
occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted
risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the
outcome within 60 days of the exposure.
  Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i.e.
exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the
majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely to correspond to true
side effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule
mining parameters for specific health outcomes.
  This paper shows that it may be possible to filter signals at a patient level
based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical
histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate
the tuning of the method's parameters.

    <title>Strictly Batch Imitation Learning by Energy-based Distribution Matching</title>
    <summary>  Consider learning a policy purely on the basis of demonstrated behavior --
that is, with no access to reinforcement signals, no knowledge of transition
dynamics, and no further interaction with the environment. This *strictly batch
imitation learning* problem arises wherever live experimentation is costly,
such as in healthcare. One solution is simply to retrofit existing algorithms
for apprenticeship learning to work in the offline setting. But such an
approach leans heavily on off-policy evaluation or offline model estimation,
and can be indirect and inefficient. We argue that a good solution should be
able to explicitly parameterize a policy (i.e. respecting action conditionals),
implicitly learn from rollout dynamics (i.e. leveraging state marginals), and
-- crucially -- operate in an entirely offline fashion. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel technique by *energy-based distribution matching*
(EDM): By identifying parameterizations of the (discriminative) model of a
policy with the (generative) energy function for state distributions, EDM
yields a simple but effective solution that equivalently minimizes a divergence
between the occupancy measure for the demonstrator and a model thereof for the
imitator. Through experiments with application to control and healthcare
settings, we illustrate consistent performance gains over existing algorithms
for strictly batch imitation learning.

    <title>Deep Claim: Payer Response Prediction from Claims Data with Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Each year, almost 10% of claims are denied by payers (i.e., health insurance
plans). With the cost to recover these denials and underpayments, predicting
payer response (likelihood of payment) from claims data with a high degree of
accuracy and precision is anticipated to improve healthcare staffs' performance
productivity and drive better patient financial experience and satisfaction in
the revenue cycle (Barkholz, 2017). However, constructing advanced predictive
analytics models has been considered challenging in the last twenty years. That
said, we propose a (low-level) context-dependent compact representation of
patients' historical claim records by effectively learning complicated
dependencies in the (high-level) claim inputs. Built on this new latent
representation, we demonstrate that a deep learning-based framework, Deep
Claim, can accurately predict various responses from multiple payers using
2,905,026 de-identified claims data from two US health systems. Deep Claim's
improvements over carefully chosen baselines in predicting claim denials are
most pronounced as 22.21% relative recall gain (at 95% precision) on Health
System A, which implies Deep Claim can find 22.21% more denials than the best
baseline system.

    <title>Non-Convex Optimization with Spectral Radius Regularization</title>
    <summary>  We develop a regularization method which finds flat minima during the
training of deep neural networks and other machine learning models. These
minima generalize better than sharp minima, allowing models to better
generalize to real word test data, which may be distributed differently from
the training data. Specifically, we propose a method of regularized
optimization to reduce the spectral radius of the Hessian of the loss function.
Additionally, we derive algorithms to efficiently perform this optimization on
neural networks and prove convergence results for these algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm works effectively on multiple
real world applications in multiple domains including healthcare. In order to
show our models generalize well, we introduce different methods of testing
generalizability.

    <title>Accountability in Offline Reinforcement Learning: Explaining Decisions
  with a Corpus of Examples</title>
    <summary>  Learning controllers with offline data in decision-making systems is an
essential area of research due to its potential to reduce the risk of
applications in real-world systems. However, in responsibility-sensitive
settings such as healthcare, decision accountability is of paramount
importance, yet has not been adequately addressed by the literature. This paper
introduces the Accountable Offline Controller (AOC) that employs the offline
dataset as the Decision Corpus and performs accountable control based on a
tailored selection of examples, referred to as the Corpus Subset. AOC operates
effectively in low-data scenarios, can be extended to the strictly offline
imitation setting, and displays qualities of both conservation and
adaptability. We assess AOC's performance in both simulated and real-world
healthcare scenarios, emphasizing its capability to manage offline control
tasks with high levels of performance while maintaining accountability.

    <title>Artificial neural networks condensation: A strategy to facilitate
  adaption of machine learning in medical settings by reducing computational
  burden</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) applications on healthcare can have a great impact on
people's lives helping deliver better and timely treatment to those in need. At
the same time, medical data is usually big and sparse requiring important
computational resources. Although it might not be a problem for wide-adoption
of ML tools in developed nations, availability of computational resource can
very well be limited in third-world nations. This can prevent the less favored
people from benefiting of the advancement in ML applications for healthcare. In
this project we explored methods to increase computational efficiency of ML
algorithms, in particular Artificial Neural Nets (NN), while not compromising
the accuracy of the predicted results. We used in-hospital mortality prediction
as our case analysis based on the MIMIC III publicly available dataset. We
explored three methods on two different NN architectures. We reduced the size
of recurrent neural net (RNN) and dense neural net (DNN) by applying pruning of
"unused" neurons. Additionally, we modified the RNN structure by adding a
hidden-layer to the LSTM cell allowing to use less recurrent layers for the
model. Finally, we implemented quantization on DNN forcing the weights to be
8-bits instead of 32-bits. We found that all our methods increased
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy and some of them even
achieved higher accuracy than the pre-condensed baseline models.

    <title>Predicting Infant Motor Development Status using Day Long Movement Data
  from Wearable Sensors</title>
    <summary>  Infants with a variety of complications at or before birth are classified as
being at risk for developmental delays (AR). As they grow older, they are
followed by healthcare providers in an effort to discern whether they are on a
typical or impaired developmental trajectory. Often, it is difficult to make an
accurate determination early in infancy as infants with typical development
(TD) display high variability in their developmental trajectories both in
content and timing. Studies have shown that spontaneous movements have the
potential to differentiate typical and atypical trajectories early in life
using sensors and kinematic analysis systems. In this study, machine learning
classification algorithms are used to take inertial movement from wearable
sensors placed on an infant for a day and predict if the infant is AR or TD,
thus further establishing the connection between early spontaneous movement and
developmental trajectory.

    <title>Graph Enabled Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer</title>
    <summary>  To leverage machine learning in any decision-making process, one must convert
the given knowledge (for example, natural language, unstructured text) into
representation vectors that can be understood and processed by machine learning
model in their compatible language and data format. The frequently encountered
difficulty is, however, the given knowledge is not rich or reliable enough in
the first place. In such cases, one seeks to fuse side information from a
separate domain to mitigate the gap between good representation learning and
the scarce knowledge in the domain of interest. This approach is named
Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer. It is crucial to study the problem because of
the commonality of scarce knowledge in many scenarios, from online healthcare
platform analyses to financial market risk quantification, leaving an obstacle
in front of us benefiting from automated decision making. From the machine
learning perspective, the paradigm of semi-supervised learning takes advantage
of large amount of data without ground truth and achieves impressive learning
performance improvement. It is adopted in this dissertation for cross-domain
knowledge transfer. (to be continued)

    <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Teeth Segmentation and Orientation from
  Panoramic X-rays</title>
    <summary>  Accurate teeth segmentation and orientation are fundamental in modern oral
healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and dental implant
design. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to teeth
segmentation and orientation from panoramic X-ray images, leveraging deep
learning techniques. We build our model based on FUSegNet, a popular model
originally developed for wound segmentation, and introduce modifications by
incorporating grid-based attention gates into the skip connections. We
introduce oriented bounding box (OBB) generation through principal component
analysis (PCA) for precise tooth orientation estimation. Evaluating our
approach on the publicly available DNS dataset, comprising 543 panoramic X-ray
images, we achieve the highest Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 82.43%
and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 90.37% among compared models in
teeth instance segmentation. In OBB analysis, we obtain the Rotated IoU (RIoU)
score of 82.82%. We also conduct detailed analyses of individual tooth labels
and categorical performance, shedding light on strengths and weaknesses. The
proposed model's accuracy and versatility offer promising prospects for
improving dental diagnoses, treatment planning, and personalized healthcare in
the oral domain. Our generated OBB coordinates and codes are available at
https://github.com/mrinal054/Instance_teeth_segmentation.

    <title>A Secure and Trustworthy Network Architecture for Federated Learning
  Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for
privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in sensitive domains such as
healthcare. In this context, the TRUSTroke project aims to leverage FL to
assist clinicians in ischemic stroke prediction. This paper provides an
overview of the TRUSTroke FL network infrastructure. The proposed architecture
adopts a client-server model with a central Parameter Server (PS). We introduce
a Docker-based design for the client nodes, offering a flexible solution for
implementing FL processes in clinical settings. The impact of different
communication protocols (HTTP or MQTT) on FL network operation is analyzed,
with MQTT selected for its suitability in FL scenarios. A control plane to
support the main operations required by FL processes is also proposed. The
paper concludes with an analysis of security aspects of the FL architecture,
addressing potential threats and proposing mitigation strategies to increase
the trustworthiness level.

    <title>Unveiling Intractable Epileptogenic Brain Networks with Deep Learning
  Algorithms: A Novel and Comprehensive Framework for Scalable Seizure
  Prediction with Unimodal Neuroimaging Data in Pediatric Patients</title>
    <summary>  Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting 50 million
individuals worldwide and 1.2 million Americans. There exist millions of
pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, a condition in which seizures
fail to come under control. The occurrence of seizures can result in physical
injury, disorientation, unconsciousness, and additional symptoms that could
impede children's ability to participate in everyday tasks. Predicting seizures
can help parents and healthcare providers take precautions, prevent risky
situations, and mentally prepare children to minimize anxiety and nervousness
associated with the uncertainty of a seizure. This research proposes a novel
and comprehensive framework to predict seizures in pediatric patients by
evaluating machine learning algorithms on unimodal neuroimaging data consisting
of electroencephalogram signals. The bandpass filtering and independent
component analysis proved to be effective in reducing the noise and artifacts
from the dataset. Various machine learning algorithms' performance is evaluated
on important metrics such as accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1
score and MCC. The results show that the deep learning algorithms are more
successful in predicting seizures than logistic Regression, and k nearest
neighbors. The recurrent neural network (RNN) gave the highest precision and F1
Score, long short-term memory (LSTM) outperformed RNN in accuracy and
convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the highest Specificity. This
research has significant implications for healthcare providers in proactively
managing seizure occurrence in pediatric patients, potentially transforming
clinical practices, and improving pediatric care.

    <title>Auditing Algorithmic Fairness in Machine Learning for Health with
  Severity-Based LOGAN</title>
    <summary>  Auditing machine learning-based (ML) healthcare tools for bias is critical to
preventing patient harm, especially in communities that disproportionately face
health inequities. General frameworks are becoming increasingly available to
measure ML fairness gaps between groups. However, ML for health (ML4H) auditing
principles call for a contextual, patient-centered approach to model
assessment. Therefore, ML auditing tools must be (1) better aligned with ML4H
auditing principles and (2) able to illuminate and characterize communities
vulnerable to the most harm. To address this gap, we propose supplementing ML4H
auditing frameworks with SLOGAN (patient Severity-based LOcal Group biAs
detectioN), an automatic tool for capturing local biases in a clinical
prediction task. SLOGAN adapts an existing tool, LOGAN (LOcal Group biAs
detectioN), by contextualizing group bias detection in patient illness severity
and past medical history. We investigate and compare SLOGAN's bias detection
capabilities to LOGAN and other clustering techniques across patient subgroups
in the MIMIC-III dataset. On average, SLOGAN identifies larger fairness
disparities in over 75% of patient groups than LOGAN while maintaining
clustering quality. Furthermore, in a diabetes case study, health disparity
literature corroborates the characterizations of the most biased clusters
identified by SLOGAN. Our results contribute to the broader discussion of how
machine learning biases may perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.

    <title>Diabetes Mellitus Forecasting Using Population Health Data in Ontario,
  Canada</title>
    <summary>  Leveraging health administrative data (HAD) datasets for predicting the risk
of chronic diseases including diabetes has gained a lot of attention in the
machine learning community recently. In this paper, we use the largest health
records datasets of patients in Ontario,Canada. Provided by the Institute of
Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), this database is age, gender and
ethnicity-diverse. The datasets include demographics, lab measurements,drug
benefits, healthcare system interactions, ambulatory and hospitalizations
records. We perform one of the first large-scale machine learning studies with
this data to study the task of predicting diabetes in a range of 1-10 years
ahead, which requires no additional screening of individuals.In the best setup,
we reach a test AUC of 80.3 with a single-model trained on an observation
window of 5 years with a one-year buffer using all datasets. A subset of top 15
features alone (out of a total of 963) could provide a test AUC of 79.1. In
this paper, we provide extensive machine learning model performance and feature
contribution analysis, which enables us to narrow down to the most important
features useful for diabetes forecasting. Examples include chronic conditions
such as asthma and hypertension, lab results, diagnostic codes in insurance
claims, age and geographical information.

    <title>Interpretable machine learning for time-to-event prediction in medicine
  and healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Time-to-event prediction, e.g. cancer survival analysis or hospital length of
stay, is a highly prominent machine learning task in medical and healthcare
applications. However, only a few interpretable machine learning methods comply
with its challenges. To facilitate a comprehensive explanatory analysis of
survival models, we formally introduce time-dependent feature effects and
global feature importance explanations. We show how post-hoc interpretation
methods allow for finding biases in AI systems predicting length of stay using
a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 X-ray images with textual
radiology reports annotated by human experts. Moreover, we evaluate cancer
survival models beyond predictive performance to include the importance of
multi-omics feature groups based on a large-scale benchmark comprising 11
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Model developers can use the
proposed methods to debug and improve machine learning algorithms, while
physicians can discover disease biomarkers and assess their significance. We
hope the contributed open data and code resources facilitate future work in the
emerging research direction of explainable survival analysis.

    <title>Bridging Medical Data Inference to Achilles Tendon Rupture
  Rehabilitation</title>
    <summary>  Imputing incomplete medical tests and predicting patient outcomes are crucial
for guiding the decision making for therapy, such as after an Achilles Tendon
Rupture (ATR). We formulate the problem of data imputation and prediction for
ATR relevant medical measurements into a recommender system framework. By
applying MatchBox, which is a collaborative filtering approach, on a real
dataset collected from 374 ATR patients, we aim at offering personalized
medical data imputation and prediction. In this work, we show the feasibility
of this approach and discuss potential research directions by conducting
initial qualitative evaluations.

    <title>DMIDAS: Deep Mixed Data Sampling Regression for Long Multi-Horizon Time
  Series Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Neural forecasting has shown significant improvements in the accuracy of
large-scale systems, yet predicting extremely long horizons remains a
challenging task. Two common problems are the volatility of the predictions and
their computational complexity; we addressed them by incorporating smoothness
regularization and mixed data sampling techniques to a well-performing
multi-layer perceptron based architecture (NBEATS). We validate our proposed
method, DMIDAS, on high-frequency healthcare and electricity price data with
long forecasting horizons (~1000 timestamps) where we improve the prediction
accuracy by 5% over state-of-the-art models, reducing the number of parameters
of NBEATS by nearly 70%.

    <title>The Use of Autoencoders for Discovering Patient Phenotypes</title>
    <summary>  We use autoencoders to create low-dimensional embeddings of underlying
patient phenotypes that we hypothesize are a governing factor in determining
how different patients will react to different interventions. We compare the
performance of autoencoders that take fixed length sequences of concatenated
timesteps as input with a recurrent sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We
evaluate our methods on around 35,500 patients from the latest MIMIC III
dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.

    <title>A Sentiment Analysis of Breast Cancer Treatment Experiences and
  Healthcare Perceptions Across Twitter</title>
    <summary>  Background: Social media has the capacity to afford the healthcare industry
with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical
decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators
both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have
studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of
tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online
public testimonies as "Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes" (iPROs), because
they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional
means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets
related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for
monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled
over 5.3 million "breast cancer" related tweets spanning September 2016 until
mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural
language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient
experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor
accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with
a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged
topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding
patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further
discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing
on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage.
Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss
their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment
needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare
professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.

    <title>Automated Fusion of Multimodal Electronic Health Records for Better
  Medical Predictions</title>
    <summary>  The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in
healthcare institutes has generated vast amounts of medical data, offering
significant opportunities for improving healthcare services through deep
learning techniques. However, the complex and diverse modalities and feature
structures in real-world EHR data pose great challenges for deep learning model
design. To address the multi-modality challenge in EHR data, current approaches
primarily rely on hand-crafted model architectures based on intuition and
empirical experiences, leading to sub-optimal model architectures and limited
performance. Therefore, to automate the process of model design for mining EHR
data, we propose a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework named
AutoFM, which can automatically search for the optimal model architectures for
encoding diverse input modalities and fusion strategies. We conduct thorough
experiments on real-world multi-modal EHR data and prediction tasks, and the
results demonstrate that our framework not only achieves significant
performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods but also
discovers meaningful network architectures effectively.

    <title>Next Visit Diagnosis Prediction via Medical Code-Centric Multimodal
  Contrastive EHR Modelling with Hierarchical Regularisation</title>
    <summary>  Predicting next visit diagnosis using Electronic Health Records (EHR) is an
essential task in healthcare, critical for devising proactive future plans for
both healthcare providers and patients. Nonetheless, many preceding studies
have not sufficiently addressed the heterogeneous and hierarchical
characteristics inherent in EHR data, inevitably leading to sub-optimal
performance. To this end, we propose NECHO, a novel medical code-centric
multimodal contrastive EHR learning framework with hierarchical regularisation.
First, we integrate multifaceted information encompassing medical codes,
demographics, and clinical notes using a tailored network design and a pair of
bimodal contrastive losses, all of which pivot around a medical codes
representation. We also regularise modality-specific encoders using a parental
level information in medical ontology to learn hierarchical structure of EHR
data. A series of experiments on MIMIC-III data demonstrates effectiveness of
our approach.

    <title>From Plate to Prevention: A Dietary Nutrient-aided Platform for Health
  Promotion in Singapore</title>
    <summary>  Singapore has been striving to improve the provision of healthcare services
to her people. In this course, the government has taken note of the deficiency
in regulating and supervising people's nutrient intake, which is identified as
a contributing factor to the development of chronic diseases. Consequently,
this issue has garnered significant attention. In this paper, we share our
experience in addressing this issue and attaining medical-grade nutrient intake
information to benefit Singaporeans in different aspects. To this end, we
develop the FoodSG platform to incubate diverse healthcare-oriented
applications as a service in Singapore, taking into account their shared
requirements. We further identify the profound meaning of localized food
datasets and systematically clean and curate a localized Singaporean food
dataset FoodSG-233. To overcome the hurdle in recognition performance brought
by Singaporean multifarious food dishes, we propose to integrate supervised
contrastive learning into our food recognition model FoodSG-SCL for the
intrinsic capability to mine hard positive/negative samples and therefore boost
the accuracy. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we present performance
results of the proposed model and insights on food-related healthcare
applications. The FoodSG-233 dataset has been released in
https://foodlg.comp.nus.edu.sg/.

    <title>A Systems Theoretic Approach to Online Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  The machine learning formulation of online learning is incomplete from a
systems theoretic perspective. Typically, machine learning research emphasizes
domains and tasks, and a problem solving worldview. It focuses on algorithm
parameters, features, and samples, and neglects the perspective offered by
considering system structure and system behavior or dynamics. Online learning
is an active field of research and has been widely explored in terms of
statistical theory and computational algorithms, however, in general, the
literature still lacks formal system theoretical frameworks for modeling online
learning systems and resolving systems-related concept drift issues.
Furthermore, while the machine learning formulation serves to classify methods
and literature, the systems theoretic formulation presented herein serves to
provide a framework for the top-down design of online learning systems,
including a novel definition of online learning and the identification of key
design parameters. The framework is formulated in terms of input-output systems
and is further divided into system structure and system behavior. Concept drift
is a critical challenge faced in online learning, and this work formally
approaches it as part of the system behavior characteristics. Healthcare
provider fraud detection using machine learning is used as a case study

    <title>Syn-Mediverse: A Multimodal Synthetic Dataset for Intelligent Scene
  Understanding of Healthcare Facilities</title>
    <summary>  Safety and efficiency are paramount in healthcare facilities where the lives
of patients are at stake. Despite the adoption of robots to assist medical
staff in challenging tasks such as complex surgeries, human expertise is still
indispensable. The next generation of autonomous healthcare robots hinges on
their capacity to perceive and understand their complex and frenetic
environments. While deep learning models are increasingly used for this
purpose, they require extensive annotated training data which is impractical to
obtain in real-world healthcare settings. To bridge this gap, we present
Syn-Mediverse, the first hyper-realistic multimodal synthetic dataset of
diverse healthcare facilities. Syn-Mediverse contains over \num{48000} images
from a simulated industry-standard optical tracking camera and provides more
than 1.5M annotations spanning five different scene understanding tasks
including depth estimation, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance
segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. We demonstrate the complexity of our
dataset by evaluating the performance on a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines for each task. To further advance research on scene understanding of
healthcare facilities, along with the public dataset we provide an online
evaluation benchmark available at \url{http://syn-mediverse.cs.uni-freiburg.de}

    <title>An Integrated Optimization and Machine Learning Models to Predict the
  Admission Status of Emergency Patients</title>
    <summary>  This work proposes a framework for optimizing machine learning algorithms.
The practicality of the framework is illustrated using an important case study
from the healthcare domain, which is predicting the admission status of
emergency department (ED) patients (e.g., admitted vs. discharged) using
patient data at the time of triage. The proposed framework can mitigate the
crowding problem by proactively planning the patient boarding process. A large
retrospective dataset of patient records is obtained from the electronic health
record database of all ED visits over three years from three major locations of
a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US. Three machine learning
algorithms are proposed: T-XGB, T-ADAB, and T-MLP. T-XGB integrates extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and Tabu Search (TS), T-ADAB integrates Adaboost and
TS, and T-MLP integrates multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and TS. The proposed
algorithms are compared with the traditional algorithms: XGB, ADAB, and MLP, in
which their parameters are tunned using grid search. The three proposed
algorithms and the original ones are trained and tested using nine data groups
that are obtained from different feature selection methods. In other words, 54
models are developed. Performance was evaluated using five measures: Area under
the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, F1, and accuracy. The results show
that the newly proposed algorithms resulted in high AUC and outperformed the
traditional algorithms. The T-ADAB performs the best among the newly developed
algorithms. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, F1, and accuracy of the best
model are 95.4%, 99.3%, 91.4%, 95.2%, 97.2%, respectively.

    <title>Big Data Intelligence Using Distributed Deep Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Large amount of data is often required to train and deploy useful machine
learning models in industry. Smaller enterprises do not have the luxury of
accessing enough data for machine learning, For privacy sensitive fields such
as banking, insurance and healthcare, aggregating data to a data warehouse
poses a challenge of data security and limited computational resources. These
challenges are critical when developing machine learning algorithms in
industry. Several attempts have been made to address the above challenges by
using distributed learning techniques such as federated learning over disparate
data stores in order to circumvent the need for centralised data aggregation.
This paper proposes an improved algorithm to securely train deep neural
networks over several data sources in a distributed way, in order to eliminate
the need to centrally aggregate the data and the need to share the data thus
preserving privacy. The proposed method allows training of deep neural networks
using data from multiple de-linked nodes in a distributed environment and to
secure the representation shared during training. Only a representation of the
trained models (network architecture and weights) are shared. The algorithm was
evaluated on existing healthcare patients data and the performance of this
implementation was compared to that of a regular deep neural network trained on
a single centralised architecture. This algorithm will pave a way for
distributed training of neural networks on privacy sensitive applications where
raw data may not be shared directly or centrally aggregating this data in a
data warehouse is not feasible.

    <title>A Survey of Demonstration Learning</title>
    <summary>  With the fast improvement of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL)
has been used to automate human tasks in different areas. However, training
such agents is difficult and restricted to expert users. Moreover, it is mostly
limited to simulation environments due to the high cost and safety concerns of
interactions in the real world. Demonstration Learning is a paradigm in which
an agent learns to perform a task by imitating the behavior of an expert shown
in demonstrations. It is a relatively recent area in machine learning, but it
is gaining significant traction due to having tremendous potential for learning
complex behaviors from demonstrations. Learning from demonstration accelerates
the learning process by improving sample efficiency, while also reducing the
effort of the programmer. Due to learning without interacting with the
environment, demonstration learning would allow the automation of a wide range
of real world applications such as robotics and healthcare. This paper provides
a survey of demonstration learning, where we formally introduce the
demonstration problem along with its main challenges and provide a
comprehensive overview of the process of learning from demonstrations from the
creation of the demonstration data set, to learning methods from
demonstrations, and optimization by combining demonstration learning with
different machine learning methods. We also review the existing benchmarks and
identify their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of the paradigm as well as its main applications.
Lastly, we discuss our perspective on open problems and research directions for
this rapidly growing field.

    <title>Does Deep Learning REALLY Outperform Non-deep Machine Learning for
  Clinical Prediction on Physiological Time Series?</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning has been widely used in healthcare applications to
approximate complex models, for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
As deep learning has the outstanding ability to extract information from time
series, its true capabilities on sparse, irregularly sampled, multivariate, and
imbalanced physiological data are not yet fully explored. In this paper, we
systematically examine the performance of machine learning models for the
clinical prediction task based on the EHR, especially physiological time
series. We choose Physionet 2019 challenge public dataset to predict Sepsis
outcomes in ICU units. Ten baseline machine learning models are compared,
including 3 deep learning methods and 7 non-deep learning methods, commonly
used in the clinical prediction domain. Nine evaluation metrics with specific
clinical implications are used to assess the performance of models. Besides, we
sub-sample training dataset sizes and use learning curve fit to investigate the
impact of the training dataset size on the performance of the machine learning
models. We also propose the general pre-processing method for the physiology
time-series data and use Dice Loss to deal with the dataset imbalanced problem.
The results show that deep learning indeed outperforms non-deep learning, but
with certain conditions: firstly, evaluating with some particular evaluation
metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, Sensitivity, and FNR), but not others; secondly, the
training dataset size is large enough (with an estimation of a magnitude of
thousands).

    <title>Security Concerns on Machine Learning Solutions for 6G Networks in
  mmWave Beam Prediction</title>
    <summary>  6G -- sixth generation -- is the latest cellular technology currently under
development for wireless communication systems. In recent years, machine
learning algorithms have been applied widely in various fields, such as
healthcare, transportation, energy, autonomous car, and many more. Those
algorithms have been also using in communication technologies to improve the
system performance in terms of frequency spectrum usage, latency, and security.
With the rapid developments of machine learning techniques, especially deep
learning, it is critical to take the security concern into account when
applying the algorithms. While machine learning algorithms offer significant
advantages for 6G networks, security concerns on Artificial Intelligent (AI)
models is typically ignored by the scientific community so far. However,
security is also a vital part of the AI algorithms, this is because the AI
model itself can be poisoned by attackers. This paper proposes a mitigation
method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for
the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. The
main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to
produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G
applications for mmWave beam prediction. We also present the adversarial
learning mitigation method's performance for 6G security in mmWave beam
prediction application with fast gradient sign method attack. The mean square
errors (MSE) of the defended model under attack are very close to the
undefended model without attack.

    <title>Improving ECG Classification Interpretability using Saliency Maps</title>
    <summary>  Cardiovascular disease is a large worldwide healthcare issue; symptoms often
present suddenly with minimal warning. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast,
simple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring
electrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often
need to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on
improving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG
classification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can
learn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect
abnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to
generalize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which
drop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine
learning algorithms suffer a "black-box" issue, in which it is difficult to
determine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in
healthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation
in order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing
model decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using
adapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what
patterns are being learned. We do this by building two algorithms based on
state-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to
find problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model
performance. Comparing saliency maps across complete classes gives an overall
impression of confounding variables or other biases in the model, unlike what
would be highlighted when comparing saliency maps on an ECG-by-ECG basis.

    <title>Private Multi-Winner Voting for Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Private multi-winner voting is the task of revealing $k$-hot binary vectors
satisfying a bounded differential privacy (DP) guarantee. This task has been
understudied in machine learning literature despite its prevalence in many
domains such as healthcare. We propose three new DP multi-winner mechanisms:
Binary, $\tau$, and Powerset voting. Binary voting operates independently per
label through composition. $\tau$ voting bounds votes optimally in their
$\ell_2$ norm for tight data-independent guarantees. Powerset voting operates
over the entire binary vector by viewing the possible outcomes as a power set.
Our theoretical and empirical analysis shows that Binary voting can be a
competitive mechanism on many tasks unless there are strong correlations
between labels, in which case Powerset voting outperforms it. We use our
mechanisms to enable privacy-preserving multi-label learning in the central
setting by extending the canonical single-label technique: PATE. We find that
our techniques outperform current state-of-the-art approaches on large,
real-world healthcare data and standard multi-label benchmarks. We further
enable multi-label confidential and private collaborative (CaPC) learning and
show that model performance can be significantly improved in the multi-site
setting.

    <title>XAI4LLM. Let Machine Learning Models and LLMs Collaborate for Enhanced
  In-Context Learning in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics
offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the
development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured
prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the
user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data
incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which
employs long narrative prompts.
  Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors,
including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient
records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional
clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot
and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when
employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as
sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased
number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the
performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior
cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.
  This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored
communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes.
The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training
examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM
applications.

    <title>Real-Time Magnetic Tracking and Diagnosis of COVID-19 via Machine
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of reliable, noninvasive
diagnostic tools for robust public health interventions. In this work, we fused
magnetic respiratory sensing technology (MRST) with machine learning (ML) to
create a diagnostic platform for real-time tracking and diagnosis of COVID-19
and other respiratory diseases. The MRST precisely captures breathing patterns
through three specific breath testing protocols: normal breath, holding breath,
and deep breath. We collected breath data from both COVID-19 patients and
healthy subjects in Vietnam using this platform, which then served to train and
validate ML models. Our evaluation encompassed multiple ML algorithms,
including support vector machines and deep learning models, assessing their
ability to diagnose COVID-19. Our multi-model validation methodology ensures a
thorough comparison and grants the adaptability to select the most optimal
model, striking a balance between diagnostic precision with model
interpretability. The findings highlight the exceptional potential of our

    <title>Securing AI-based Healthcare Systems using Blockchain Technology: A
  State-of-the-Art Systematic Literature Review and Future Research Directions</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence
into their systems, but it is not a solution for all difficulties. AI's
extraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of
medical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of
trust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology
can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This
paper has conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the
state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications
developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This
systematic literature review proceeds with three different paths as natural
language processing-based healthcare systems, computer vision-based healthcare
systems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found that 1) Defence
techniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of
attacks and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further
prone to different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy
issues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data verification and user
provenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect
distributed learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single
point of failure, non-transparency in healthcare systems can be resolved with
Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that research is at the
initial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using
Blockchain Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the
needs of each NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global
solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI based healthcare. However,
this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be addressed
in future studies.

    <title>SLEEPER: interpretable Sleep staging via Prototypes from Expert Rules</title>
    <summary>  Sleep staging is a crucial task for diagnosing sleep disorders. It is tedious
and complex as it can take a trained expert several hours to annotate just one
patient's polysomnogram (PSG) from a single night. Although deep learning
models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in automating sleep
staging, interpretability which defines other desiderata, has largely remained
unexplored. In this study, we propose Sleep staging via Prototypes from Expert
Rules (SLEEPER), which combines deep learning models with expert defined rules
using a prototype learning framework to generate simple interpretable models.
In particular, SLEEPER utilizes sleep scoring rules and expert defined features
to derive prototypes which are embeddings of PSG data fragments via
convolutional neural networks. The final models are simple interpretable models
like a shallow decision tree defined over those phenotypes. We evaluated
SLEEPER using two PSG datasets collected from sleep studies and demonstrated
that SLEEPER could provide accurate sleep stage classification comparable to
human experts and deep neural networks with about 85% ROC-AUC and .7 kappa.

    <title>Enhancement of Healthcare Data Performance Metrics using Neural Network
  Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Patients are often encouraged to make use of wearable devices for remote
collection and monitoring of health data. This adoption of wearables results in
a significant increase in the volume of data collected and transmitted. The
battery life of the devices is then quickly diminished due to the high
processing requirements of the devices. Given the importance attached to
medical data, it is imperative that all transmitted data adhere to strict
integrity and availability requirements. Reducing the volume of healthcare data
for network transmission may improve sensor battery life without compromising
accuracy. There is a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy which can be
controlled by adjusting the sampling and transmission rates. This paper
demonstrates that machine learning can be used to analyse complex health data
metrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission to overcome
the trade-off problem. The study uses time series nonlinear autoregressive
neural network algorithms to enhance both data metrics by taking fewer samples
to transmit. The algorithms were tested with a standard heart rate dataset to
compare their accuracy and efficiency. The result showed that the
Levenbery-Marquardt algorithm was the best performer with an efficiency of 3.33
and accuracy of 79.17%, which is similar to other algorithms accuracy but
demonstrates improved efficiency. This proves that machine learning can improve
without sacrificing a metric over the other compared to the existing methods
with high efficiency.

    <title>Classifying Unstructured Clinical Notes via Automatic Weak Supervision</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare providers usually record detailed notes of the clinical care
delivered to each patient for clinical, research, and billing purposes. Due to
the unstructured nature of these narratives, providers employ dedicated staff
to assign diagnostic codes to patients' diagnoses using the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system. This manual process is not only
time-consuming but also costly and error-prone. Prior work demonstrated
potential utility of Machine Learning (ML) methodology in automating this
process, but it has relied on large quantities of manually labeled data to
train the models. Additionally, diagnostic coding systems evolve with time,
which makes traditional supervised learning strategies unable to generalize
beyond local applications. In this work, we introduce a general
weakly-supervised text classification framework that learns from class-label
descriptions only, without the need to use any human-labeled documents. It
leverages the linguistic domain knowledge stored within pre-trained language
models and the data programming framework to assign code labels to individual
texts. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our method by comparing
it to state-of-the-art weak text classifiers across four real-world text
classification datasets, in addition to assigning ICD codes to medical notes in
the publicly available MIMIC-III database.

    <title>COVID-Net USPro: An Open-Source Explainable Few-Shot Deep Prototypical
  Network to Monitor and Detect COVID-19 Infection from Point-of-Care
  Ultrasound Images</title>
    <summary>  As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact many aspects
of life and the global healthcare systems, the adoption of rapid and effective
screening methods to prevent further spread of the virus and lessen the burden
on healthcare providers is a necessity. As a cheap and widely accessible
medical image modality, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging allows
radiologists to identify symptoms and assess severity through visual inspection
of the chest ultrasound images. Combined with the recent advancements in
computer science, applications of deep learning techniques in medical image
analysis have shown promising results, demonstrating that artificial
intelligence-based solutions can accelerate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and lower
the burden on healthcare professionals. However, the lack of a huge amount of
well-annotated data poses a challenge in building effective deep neural
networks in the case of novel diseases and pandemics. Motivated by this, we
present COVID-Net USPro, an explainable few-shot deep prototypical network,
that monitors and detects COVID-19 positive cases with high precision and
recall from minimal ultrasound images. COVID-Net USPro achieves 99.65% overall
accuracy, 99.7% recall and 99.67% precision for COVID-19 positive cases when
trained with only 5 shots. The analytic pipeline and results were verified by
our contributing clinician with extensive experience in POCUS interpretation,
ensuring that the network makes decisions based on actual patterns.

    <title>Graph Representation Learning in Biomedicine</title>
    <summary>  Biomedical networks (or graphs) are universal descriptors for systems of
interacting elements, from molecular interactions and disease co-morbidity to
healthcare systems and scientific knowledge. Advances in artificial
intelligence, specifically deep learning, have enabled us to model, analyze,
and learn with such networked data. In this review, we put forward an
observation that long-standing principles of systems biology and medicine --
while often unspoken in machine learning research -- provide the conceptual
grounding for representation learning on graphs, explain its current successes
and limitations, and even inform future advancements. We synthesize a spectrum
of algorithmic approaches that, at their core, leverage graph topology to embed
networks into compact vector spaces. We also capture the breadth of ways in
which representation learning has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in
biomedical machine learning. Exemplary domains covered include identifying
variants underlying complex traits, disentangling behaviors of single cells and
their effects on health, assisting in diagnosis and treatment of patients, and
developing safe and effective medicines.

    <title>Online Disease Self-diagnosis with Inductive Heterogeneous Graph
  Convolutional Networks</title>
    <summary>  We propose a Healthcare Graph Convolutional Network (HealGCN) to offer
disease self-diagnosis service for online users based on Electronic Healthcare
Records (EHRs). Two main challenges are focused in this paper for online
disease diagnosis: (1) serving cold-start users via graph convolutional
networks and (2) handling scarce clinical description via a symptom retrieval
system. To this end, we first organize the EHR data into a heterogeneous graph
that is capable of modeling complex interactions among users, symptoms and
diseases, and tailor the graph representation learning towards disease
diagnosis with an inductive learning paradigm. Then, we build a disease
self-diagnosis system with a corresponding EHR Graph-based Symptom Retrieval
System (GraphRet) that can search and provide a list of relevant alternative
symptoms by tracing the predefined meta-paths. GraphRet helps enrich the seed
symptom set through the EHR graph when confronting users with scarce
descriptions, hence yield better diagnosis accuracy. At last, we validate the
superiority of our model on a large-scale EHR dataset.

    <title>Curating Naturally Adversarial Datasets for Learning-Enabled Medical
  Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have shown promising predictive accuracy for time-series
healthcare applications. However, ensuring the robustness of these models is
vital for building trustworthy AI systems. Existing research predominantly
focuses on robustness to synthetic adversarial examples, crafted by adding
imperceptible perturbations to clean input data. However, these synthetic
adversarial examples do not accurately reflect the most challenging real-world
scenarios, especially in the context of healthcare data. Consequently,
robustness to synthetic adversarial examples may not necessarily translate to
robustness against naturally occurring adversarial examples, which is highly
desirable for trustworthy AI. We propose a method to curate datasets comprised
of natural adversarial examples to evaluate model robustness. The method relies
on probabilistic labels obtained from automated weakly-supervised labeling that
combines noisy and cheap-to-obtain labeling heuristics. Based on these labels,
our method adversarially orders the input data and uses this ordering to
construct a sequence of increasingly adversarial datasets. Our evaluation on
six medical case studies and three non-medical case studies demonstrates the
efficacy and statistical validity of our approach to generating naturally
adversarial datasets

    <title>Measuring the quality of Synthetic data for use in competitions</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the
large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much
of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data
in a way that compromises privacy. In order to overcome this hurdle, several
methods have been proposed that generate synthetic data while preserving the
privacy of the real data. In this paper we consider a key characteristic that
synthetic data should have in order to be useful for machine learning
researchers - the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested)
on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when
trained and tested) on the original dataset.

  Privacy on MIMIC-III</title>
    <summary>  Background: Federated learning methods offer the possibility of training
machine learning models on privacy-sensitive data sets, which cannot be easily
shared. Multiple regulations pose strict requirements on the storage and usage
of healthcare data, leading to data being in silos (i.e. locked-in at
healthcare facilities). The application of federated algorithms on these
datasets could accelerate disease diagnostic, drug development, as well as
improve patient care.
  Methods: We present an extensive evaluation of the impact of different
federation and differential privacy techniques when training models on the
open-source MIMIC-III dataset. We analyze a set of parameters influencing a
federated model performance, namely data distribution (homogeneous and
heterogeneous), communication strategies (communication rounds vs. local
training epochs), federation strategies (FedAvg vs. FedProx). Furthermore, we
assess and compare two differential privacy (DP) techniques during model
training: a stochastic gradient descent-based differential privacy algorithm
(DP-SGD), and a sparse vector differential privacy technique (DP-SVT).
  Results: Our experiments show that extreme data distributions across sites
(imbalance either in the number of patients or the positive label ratios
between sites) lead to a deterioration of model performance when trained using
the FedAvg strategy. This issue is resolved when using FedProx with the use of
appropriate hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the results show that both
differential privacy techniques can reach model performances similar to those
of models trained without DP, however at the expense of a large quantifiable
privacy leakage.
  Conclusions: We evaluate empirically the benefits of two federation
strategies and propose optimal strategies for the choice of parameters when
using differential privacy techniques.

    <title>Federated Learning for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE)
facilitate large-scale personalized decision-making across various domains such
as healthcare, policy making, education, and more. Current machine learning
approaches for HTE require access to substantial amounts of data per treatment,
and the high costs associated with interventions makes centrally collecting so
much data for each intervention a formidable challenge. To overcome this
obstacle, in this work, we propose a novel framework for collaborative learning
of HTE estimators across institutions via Federated Learning. We show that even
under a diversity of interventions and subject populations across clients, one
can jointly learn a common feature representation, while concurrently and
privately learning the specific predictive functions for outcomes under
distinct interventions across institutions. Our framework and the associated
algorithm are based on this insight, and leverage tabular transformers to map
multiple input data to feature representations which are then used for outcome
prediction via multi-task learning. We also propose a novel way of federated
training of personalised transformers that can work with heterogeneous input
feature spaces. Experimental results on real-world clinical trial data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    <title>Generalization Studies of Neural Network Models for Cardiac Disease
  Detection Using Limited Channel ECG</title>
    <summary>  Acceleration of machine learning research in healthcare is challenged by lack
of large annotated and balanced datasets. Furthermore, dealing with measurement
inaccuracies and exploiting unsupervised data are considered to be central to
improving existing solutions. In particular, a primary objective in predictive
modeling is to generalize well to both unseen variations within the observed
classes, and unseen classes. In this work, we consider such a challenging
problem in machine learning driven diagnosis: detecting a gamut of
cardiovascular conditions (e.g. infarction, dysrhythmia etc.) from limited
channel ECG measurements. Though deep neural networks have achieved
unprecedented success in predictive modeling, they rely solely on
discriminative models that can generalize poorly to unseen classes. We argue
that unsupervised learning can be utilized to construct effective latent spaces
that facilitate better generalization. This work extensively compares the
generalization of our proposed approach against a state-of-the-art deep
learning solution. Our results show significant improvements in F1-scores.

    <title>Rethinking clinical prediction: Why machine learning must consider year
  of care and feature aggregation</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning for healthcare often trains models on de-identified datasets
with randomly-shifted calendar dates, ignoring the fact that data were
generated under hospital operation practices that change over time. These
changing practices induce definitive changes in observed data which confound
evaluations which do not account for dates and limit the generalisability of
date-agnostic models. In this work, we establish the magnitude of this problem
on MIMIC, a public hospital dataset, and showcase a simple solution. We augment
MIMIC with the year in which care was provided and show that a model trained
using standard feature representations will significantly degrade in quality
over time. We find a deterioration of 0.3 AUC when evaluating mortality
prediction on data from 10 years later. We find a similar deterioration of 0.15
AUC for length-of-stay. In contrast, we demonstrate that clinically-oriented
aggregates of raw features significantly mitigate future deterioration. Our
suggested aggregated representations, when retrained yearly, have prediction
quality comparable to year-agnostic models.

    <title>Feature Importance and Explainability in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Many Machine Learning (ML) models are referred to as black box models,
providing no real insights into why a prediction is made. Feature importance
and explainability are important for increasing transparency and trust in ML
models, particularly in settings such as healthcare and finance. With quantum
computing's unique capabilities, such as leveraging quantum mechanical
phenomena like superposition, which can be combined with ML techniques to
create the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and such techniques may be
applied to QML models. This article explores feature importance and
explainability insights in QML compared to Classical ML models. Utilizing the
widely recognized Iris dataset, classical ML algorithms such as SVM and Random
Forests, are compared against hybrid quantum counterparts, implemented via
IBM's Qiskit platform: the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and Quantum
Support Vector Classifier (QSVC). This article aims to provide a comparison of
the insights generated in ML by employing permutation and leave one out feature
importance methods, alongside ALE (Accumulated Local Effects) and SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) explainers.

    <title>Unbox the Black-box for the Medical Explainable AI via Multi-modal and
  Multi-centre Data Fusion: A Mini-Review, Two Showcases and Beyond</title>
    <summary>  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of
machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made.
This research field inspects the measures and models involved in
decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the
machine learning algorithms can not manifest how and why a decision has been
cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network
approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be
hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI
becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications,
especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep
neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The
insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be
one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI
tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first
surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in
healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging
multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two
showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and
qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from
which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical
questions.

    <title>Improving Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Through Comparative Analysis
  of Machine Learning Models: A Case Study on Myocardial Infarction</title>
    <summary>  Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the
contemporary world. Its association with smoking, elevated blood pressure, and
cholesterol levels underscores the significance of these risk factors. This
study addresses the challenge of predicting myocardial illness, a formidable
task in medical research. Accurate predictions are pivotal for refining
healthcare strategies. This investigation conducts a comparative analysis of
six distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machine, Decision Tree, Bagging, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The attained outcomes
exhibit promise, with accuracy rates as follows: Logistic Regression (81.00%),
Support Vector Machine (75.01%), XGBoost (92.72%), LightGBM (90.60%), Decision
Tree (82.30%), and Bagging (83.01%). Notably, XGBoost emerges as the
top-performing model. These findings underscore its potential to enhance
predictive precision for coronary infarction. As the prevalence of
cardiovascular risk factors persists, incorporating advanced machine learning
techniques holds the potential to refine proactive medical interventions.

    <title>Asynchronous Collaborative Learning Across Data Silos</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning algorithms can perform well when trained on large datasets.
While large organisations often have considerable data assets, it can be
difficult for these assets to be unified in a manner that makes training
possible. Data is very often 'siloed' in different parts of the organisation,
with little to no access between silos. This fragmentation of data assets is
especially prevalent in heavily regulated industries like financial services or
healthcare. In this paper we propose a framework to enable asynchronous
collaborative training of machine learning models across data silos. This
allows data science teams to collaboratively train a machine learning model,
without sharing data with one another. Our proposed approach enhances
conventional federated learning techniques to make them suitable for this
asynchronous training in this intra-organisation, cross-silo setting. We
validate our proposed approach via extensive experiments.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning in Practice: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
    <summary>  This article is a gentle discussion about the field of reinforcement learning
in practice, about opportunities and challenges, touching a broad range of
topics, with perspectives and without technical details. The article is based
on both historical and recent research papers, surveys, tutorials, talks,
blogs, books, (panel) discussions, and workshops/conferences. Various groups of
readers, like researchers, engineers, students, managers, investors, officers,
and people wanting to know more about the field, may find the article
interesting.
  In this article, we first give a brief introduction to reinforcement learning
(RL), and its relationship with deep learning, machine learning and AI. Then we
discuss opportunities of RL, in particular, products and services, games,
bandits, recommender systems, robotics, transportation, finance and economics,
healthcare, education, combinatorial optimization, computer systems, and
science and engineering. Then we discuss challenges, in particular, 1)
foundation, 2) representation, 3) reward, 4) exploration, 5) model, simulation,
planning, and benchmarks, 6) off-policy/offline learning, 7) learning to learn
a.k.a. meta-learning, 8) explainability and interpretability, 9) constraints,
10) software development and deployment, 11) business perspectives, and 12)
more challenges. We conclude with a discussion, attempting to answer: "Why has
RL not been widely adopted in practice yet?" and "When is RL helpful?".

    <title>Dementia Prediction Applying Variational Quantum Classifier</title>
    <summary>  Dementia is the fifth cause of death worldwide with 10 million new cases
every year. Healthcare applications using machine learning techniques have
almost reached the physical limits while more data is becoming available
resulting from the increasing rate of diagnosis. Recent research in Quantum
Machine Learning (QML) techniques have found different approaches that may be
useful to accelerate the training process of existing machine learning models
and provide an alternative to learn more complex patterns. This work aims to
report a real-world application of a Quantum Machine Learning Algorithm, in
particular, we found that using the implemented version for Variational Quantum
Classiffication (VQC) in IBM's framework Qiskit allows predicting dementia in
elderly patients, this approach proves to provide more consistent results when
compared with a classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel
using different number of features.

    <title>Application of Deep Neural Networks to assess corporate Credit Rating</title>
    <summary>  Recent literature implements machine learning techniques to assess corporate
credit rating based on financial statement reports. In this work, we analyze
the performance of four neural network architectures (MLP, CNN, CNN2D, LSTM) in
predicting corporate credit rating as issued by Standard and Poor's. We analyze
companies from the energy, financial and healthcare sectors in US. The goal of
the analysis is to improve application of machine learning algorithms to credit
assessment. To this end, we focus on three questions. First, we investigate if
the algorithms perform better when using a selected subset of features, or if
it is better to allow the algorithms to select features themselves. Second, is
the temporal aspect inherent in financial data important for the results
obtained by a machine learning algorithm? Third, is there a particular neural
network architecture that consistently outperforms others with respect to input
features, sectors and holdout set? We create several case studies to answer
these questions and analyze the results using ANOVA and multiple comparison
testing procedure.

    <title>Counterfactual Explanations and Algorithmic Recourses for Machine
  Learning: A Review</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning plays a role in many deployed decision systems, often in
ways that are difficult or impossible to understand by human stakeholders.
Explaining, in a human-understandable way, the relationship between the input
and output of machine learning models is essential to the development of
trustworthy machine learning based systems. A burgeoning body of research seeks
to define the goals and methods of explainability in machine learning. In this
paper, we seek to review and categorize research on counterfactual
explanations, a specific class of explanation that provides a link between what
could have happened had input to a model been changed in a particular way.
Modern approaches to counterfactual explainability in machine learning draw
connections to the established legal doctrine in many countries, making them
appealing to fielded systems in high-impact areas such as finance and
healthcare. Thus, we design a rubric with desirable properties of
counterfactual explanation algorithms and comprehensively evaluate all
currently proposed algorithms against that rubric. Our rubric provides easy
comparison and comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of different
approaches and serves as an introduction to major research themes in this
field. We also identify gaps and discuss promising research directions in the
space of counterfactual explainability.

    <title>Falling Rule Lists</title>
    <summary>  Falling rule lists are classification models consisting of an ordered list of
if-then rules, where (i) the order of rules determines which example should be
classified by each rule, and (ii) the estimated probability of success
decreases monotonically down the list. These kinds of rule lists are inspired
by healthcare applications where patients would be stratified into risk sets
and the highest at-risk patients should be considered first. We provide a
Bayesian framework for learning falling rule lists that does not rely on
traditional greedy decision tree learning methods.

    <title>Quasi-orthonormal Encoding for Machine Learning Applications</title>
    <summary>  Most machine learning models, especially artificial neural networks, require
numerical, not categorical data. We briefly describe the advantages and
disadvantages of common encoding schemes. For example, one-hot encoding is
commonly used for attributes with a few unrelated categories and word
embeddings for attributes with many related categories (e.g., words). Neither
is suitable for encoding attributes with many unrelated categories, such as
diagnosis codes in healthcare applications. Application of one-hot encoding for
diagnosis codes, for example, can result in extremely high dimensionality with
low sample size problems or artificially induce machine learning artifacts, not
to mention the explosion of computing resources needed. Quasi-orthonormal
encoding (QOE) fills the gap. We briefly show how QOE compares to one-hot
encoding. We provide example code of how to implement QOE using popular ML
libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch and a demonstration of QOE to MNIST
handwriting samples.

    <title>Explaining Vulnerabilities to Adversarial Machine Learning through
  Visual Analytics</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models are currently being deployed in a variety of
real-world applications where model predictions are used to make decisions
about healthcare, bank loans, and numerous other critical tasks. As the
deployment of artificial intelligence technologies becomes ubiquitous, it is
unsurprising that adversaries have begun developing methods to manipulate
machine learning models to their advantage. While the visual analytics
community has developed methods for opening the black box of machine learning
models, little work has focused on helping the user understand their model
vulnerabilities in the context of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring model
vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Our framework employs a multi-faceted
visualization scheme designed to support the analysis of data poisoning attacks
from the perspective of models, data instances, features, and local structures.
We demonstrate our framework through two case studies on binary classifiers and
illustrate model vulnerabilities with respect to varying attack strategies.

    <title>Learning Under Adversarial and Interventional Shifts</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models are often trained on data from one distribution and
deployed on others. So it becomes important to design models that are robust to
distribution shifts. Most of the existing work focuses on optimizing for either
adversarial shifts or interventional shifts. Adversarial methods lack
expressivity in representing plausible shifts as they consider shifts to joint
distributions in the data. Interventional methods allow more expressivity but
provide robustness to unbounded shifts, resulting in overly conservative
models. In this work, we combine the complementary strengths of the two
approaches and propose a new formulation, RISe, for designing robust models
against a set of distribution shifts that are at the intersection of
adversarial and interventional shifts. We employ the distributionally robust
optimization framework to optimize the resulting objective in both supervised
and reinforcement learning settings. Extensive experimentation with synthetic
and real world datasets from healthcare demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

    <title>MonoNet: Towards Interpretable Models by Learning Monotonic Features</title>
    <summary>  Being able to interpret, or explain, the predictions made by a machine
learning model is of fundamental importance. This is especially true when there
is interest in deploying data-driven models to make high-stakes decisions, e.g.
in healthcare. While recent years have seen an increasing interest in
interpretable machine learning research, this field is currently lacking an
agreed-upon definition of interpretability, and some researchers have called
for a more active conversation towards a rigorous approach to interpretability.
Joining this conversation, we claim in this paper that the difficulty of
interpreting a complex model stems from the existing interactions among
features. We argue that by enforcing monotonicity between features and outputs,
we are able to reason about the effect of a single feature on an output
independently from other features, and consequently better understand the
model. We show how to structurally introduce this constraint in deep learning
models by adding new simple layers. We validate our model on benchmark
datasets, and compare our results with previously proposed interpretable
models.

    <title>Federated learning: Applications, challenges and future directions</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) is a system in which a central aggregator coordinates
the efforts of multiple clients to solve machine learning problems. This
setting allows training data to be dispersed in order to protect privacy. The
purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of FL systems with a focus on
healthcare. FL is evaluated here based on its frameworks, architectures, and
applications. It is shown here that FL solves the preceding issues with a
shared global deep learning (DL) model via a central aggregator server. This
paper examines recent developments and provides a comprehensive list of
unresolved issues, inspired by the rapid growth of FL research. In the context
of FL, several privacy methods are described, including secure multiparty
computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and stochastic
gradient descent. Furthermore, a review of various FL classes, such as
horizontal and vertical FL and federated transfer learning, is provided. FL has
applications in wireless communication, service recommendation, intelligent
medical diagnosis systems, and healthcare, all of which are discussed in this
paper. We also present a thorough review of existing FL challenges, such as
privacy protection, communication cost, system heterogeneity, and unreliable
model upload, followed by future research directions.

    <title>Impact of Medical Data Imprecision on Learning Results</title>
    <summary>  Test data measured by medical instruments often carry imprecise ranges that
include the true values. The latter are not obtainable in virtually all cases.
Most learning algorithms, however, carry out arithmetical calculations that are
subject to uncertain influence in both the learning process to obtain models
and applications of the learned models in, e.g. prediction. In this paper, we
initiate a study on the impact of imprecision on prediction results in a
healthcare application where a pre-trained model is used to predict future
state of hyperthyroidism for patients. We formulate a model for data
imprecisions. Using parameters to control the degree of imprecision, imprecise
samples for comparison experiments can be generated using this model. Further,
a group of measures are defined to evaluate the different impacts
quantitatively. More specifically, the statistics to measure the inconsistent
prediction for individual patients are defined. We perform experimental
evaluations to compare prediction results based on the data from the original
dataset and the corresponding ones generated from the proposed precision model
using the long-short-term memories (LSTM) network. The results against a real
world hyperthyroidism dataset provide insights into how small imprecisions can
cause large ranges of predicted results, which could cause mis-labeling and
inappropriate actions (treatments or no treatments) for individual patients.

    <title>BEHRT: Transformer for Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Today, despite decades of developments in medicine and the growing interest
in precision healthcare, vast majority of diagnoses happen once patients begin
to show noticeable signs of illness. Early indication and detection of
diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early
intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare
resources. The latest developments in machine learning (more specifically, deep
learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this
study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for EHR
(electronic health records), capable of multitask prediction and disease
trajectory mapping. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6
million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking absolute improvement of 8.0-10.8%,
in terms of Average Precision Score, compared to the existing state-of-the-art
deep EHR models (in terms of average precision, when predicting for the onset
of 301 conditions). In addition to its superior prediction power, BEHRT
provides a personalised view of disease trajectories through its attention
mechanism; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple
heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to
improve the accuracy of its predictions; and its (pre-)training results in
disease and patient representations that can help us get a step closer to
interpretable predictions.

    <title>Empowering Medical Imaging with Artificial Intelligence: A Review of
  Machine Learning Approaches for the Detection, and Segmentation of COVID-19
  Using Radiographic and Tomographic Images</title>
    <summary>  Since 2019, the global dissemination of the Coronavirus and its novel strains
has resulted in a surge of new infections. The use of X-ray and computed
tomography (CT) imaging techniques is critical in diagnosing and managing
COVID-19. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of medical
imaging is a powerful combination that can provide valuable support to
healthcare professionals.This paper focuses on the methodological approach of
using machine learning (ML) to enhance medical imaging for COVID-19
diagnosis.For example, deep learning can accurately distinguish lesions from
other parts of the lung without human intervention in a matter of
minutes.Moreover, ML can enhance performance efficiency by assisting
radiologists in making more precise clinical decisions, such as detecting and
distinguishing Covid-19 from different respiratory infections and segmenting
infections in CT and X-ray images, even when the lesions have varying sizes and
shapes.This article critically assesses machine learning methodologies utilized
for the segmentation, classification, and detection of Covid-19 within CT and
X-ray images, which are commonly employed tools in clinical and hospital
settings to represent the lung in various aspects and extensive detail.There is
a widespread expectation that this technology will continue to hold a central
position within the healthcare sector, driving further progress in the
management of the pandemic.

    <title>Mitigating Health Disparities in EHR via Deconfounder</title>
    <summary>  Health disparities, or inequalities between different patient demographics,
are becoming crucial in medical decision-making, especially in Electronic
Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling. To ensure the fairness of sensitive
attributes, conventional studies mainly adopt calibration or re-weighting
methods to balance the performance on among different demographic groups.
However, we argue that these methods have some limitations. First, these
methods usually mean a trade-off between the model's performance and fairness.
Second, many methods completely attribute unfairness to the data collection
process, which lacks substantial evidence. In this paper, we provide an
empirical study to discover the possibility of using deconfounder to address
the disparity issue in healthcare. Our study can be summarized in two parts.
The first part is a pilot study demonstrating the exacerbation of disparity
when unobserved confounders exist. The second part proposed a novel framework,
Parity Medical Deconfounder (PriMeD), to deal with the disparity issue in
healthcare datasets. Inspired by the deconfounder theory, PriMeD adopts a
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn latent factors (substitute
confounders) for observational data, and extensive experiments are provided to
show its effectiveness.

    <title>SNOBERT: A Benchmark for clinical notes entity linking in the SNOMED CT
  clinical terminology</title>
    <summary>  The extraction and analysis of insights from medical data, primarily stored
in free-text formats by healthcare workers, presents significant challenges due
to its unstructured nature. Medical coding, a crucial process in healthcare,
remains minimally automated due to the complexity of medical ontologies and
restricted access to medical texts for training Natural Language Processing
models. In this paper, we proposed a method, "SNOBERT," of linking text spans
in clinical notes to specific concepts in the SNOMED CT using BERT-based
models. The method consists of two stages: candidate selection and candidate
matching. The models were trained on one of the largest publicly available
dataset of labeled clinical notes. SNOBERT outperforms other classical methods
based on deep learning, as confirmed by the results of a challenge in which it
was applied.

    <title>Federated Learning: Balancing the Thin Line Between Data Intelligence
  and Privacy</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning holds great promise in learning from fragmented sensitive
data and has revolutionized how machine learning models are trained. This
article provides a systematic overview and detailed taxonomy of federated
learning. We investigate the existing security challenges in federated learning
and provide a comprehensive overview of established defense techniques for data
poisoning, inference attacks, and model poisoning attacks. The work also
presents an overview of current training challenges for federated learning,
focusing on handling non-i.i.d. data, high dimensionality issues, and
heterogeneous architecture, and discusses several solutions for the associated
challenges. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in managing federated
learning training and suggest focused research directions to address the open
questions. Potential candidate areas for federated learning, including IoT
ecosystem, healthcare applications, are discussed with a particular focus on
banking and financial domains.

    <title>Multilevel Stochastic Optimization for Imputation in Massive Medical
  Data Records</title>
    <summary>  It has long been a recognized problem that many datasets contain significant
levels of missing numerical data. A potentially critical predicate for
application of machine learning methods to datasets involves addressing this
problem. However, this is a challenging task. In this paper, we apply a
recently developed multi-level stochastic optimization approach to the problem
of imputation in massive medical records. The approach is based on
computational applied mathematics techniques and is highly accurate. In
particular, for the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) this multi-level
formulation is exact, and is significantly faster and more numerically stable.
This permits practical application of Kriging methods to data imputation
problems for massive datasets. We test this approach on data from the National
Inpatient Sample (NIS) data records, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
(HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Numerical results show that
the multi-level method significantly outperforms current approaches and is
numerically robust. It has superior accuracy as compared with methods
recommended in the recent report from HCUP. Benchmark tests show up to 75%
reductions in error. Furthermore, the results are also superior to recent state
of the art methods such as discriminative deep learning.

    <title>A Novel IoT-based Framework for Non-Invasive Human Hygiene Monitoring
  using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
    <summary>  People's personal hygiene habits speak volumes about the condition of taking
care of their bodies and health in daily lifestyle. Maintaining good hygiene
practices not only reduces the chances of contracting a disease but could also
reduce the risk of spreading illness within the community. Given the current
pandemic, daily habits such as washing hands or taking regular showers have
taken primary importance among people, especially for the elderly population
living alone at home or in an assisted living facility. This paper presents a
novel and non-invasive framework for monitoring human hygiene using vibration
sensors where we adopt Machine Learning techniques. The approach is based on a
combination of a geophone sensor, a digitizer, and a cost-efficient computer
board in a practical enclosure. Monitoring daily hygiene routines may help
healthcare professionals be proactive rather than reactive in identifying and
controlling the spread of potential outbreaks within the community. The
experimental result indicates that applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
binary classification exhibits a promising accuracy of ~95% in the
classification of different hygiene habits. Furthermore, both tree-based
classifier (Random Forrest and Decision Tree) outperforms other models by
achieving the highest accuracy (100%), which means that classifying hygiene
events using vibration and non-invasive sensors is possible for monitoring
hygiene activity.

    <title>HOPE: Human-Centric Off-Policy Evaluation for E-Learning and Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively researched for enhancing
human-environment interactions in various human-centric tasks, including
e-learning and healthcare. Since deploying and evaluating policies online are
high-stakes in such tasks, off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for inducing
effective policies. In human-centric environments, however, OPE is challenging
because the underlying state is often unobservable, while only aggregate
rewards can be observed (students' test scores or whether a patient is released
from the hospital eventually). In this work, we propose a human-centric OPE
(HOPE) to handle partial observability and aggregated rewards in such
environments. Specifically, we reconstruct immediate rewards from the
aggregated rewards considering partial observability to estimate expected total
returns. We provide a theoretical bound for the proposed method, and we have
conducted extensive experiments in real-world human-centric tasks, including
sepsis treatments and an intelligent tutoring system. Our approach reliably
predicts the returns of different policies and outperforms state-of-the-art
benchmarks using both standard validation methods and human-centric
significance tests.

    <title>Synthetic Data: Opening the data floodgates to enable faster, more
  directed development of machine learning methods</title>
    <summary>  Many ground-breaking advancements in machine learning can be attributed to
the availability of a large volume of rich data. Unfortunately, many
large-scale datasets are highly sensitive, such as healthcare data, and are not
widely available to the machine learning community. Generating synthetic data
with privacy guarantees provides one such solution, allowing meaningful
research to be carried out "at scale" - by allowing the entirety of the machine
learning community to potentially accelerate progress within a given field. In
this article, we provide a high-level view of synthetic data: what it means,
how we might evaluate it and how we might use it.

    <title>Exploring Machine Learning Algorithms for Infection Detection Using
  GC-IMS Data: A Preliminary Study</title>
    <summary>  The developing field of enhanced diagnostic techniques in the diagnosis of
infectious diseases, constitutes a crucial domain in modern healthcare. By
utilizing Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) data and
incorporating machine learning algorithms into one platform, our research aims
to tackle the ongoing issue of precise infection identification. Inspired by
these difficulties, our goals consist of creating a strong data analytics
process, enhancing machine learning (ML) models, and performing thorough
validation for clinical applications. Our research contributes to the emerging
field of advanced diagnostic technologies by integrating Gas Chromatography-Ion
Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) data and machine learning algorithms within a
unified Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) platform. Preliminary
trials demonstrate encouraging levels of accuracy when employing various ML
algorithms to differentiate between infected and non-infected samples.
Continuing endeavors are currently concentrated on enhancing the effectiveness
of the model, investigating techniques to clarify its functioning, and
incorporating many types of data to further support the early detection of
diseases.

    <title>Orthogonal Matrices for MBAT Vector Symbolic Architectures, and a "Soft"
  VSA Representation for JSON</title>
    <summary>  Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) give a way to represent a complex object
as a single fixed-length vector, so that similar objects have similar vector
representations. These vector representations then become easy to use for
machine learning or nearest-neighbor search. We review a previously proposed
VSA method, MBAT (Matrix Binding of Additive Terms), which uses multiplication
by random matrices for binding related terms. However, multiplying by such
matrices introduces instabilities which can harm performance. Making the random
matrices be orthogonal matrices provably fixes this problem. With respect to
larger scale applications, we see how to apply MBAT vector representations for
any data expressed in JSON. JSON is used in numerous programming languages to
express complex data, but its native format appears highly unsuited for machine
learning. Expressing JSON as a fixed-length vector makes it readily usable for
machine learning and nearest-neighbor search. Creating such JSON vectors also
shows that a VSA needs to employ binding operations that are non-commutative.
  VSAs are now ready to try with full-scale practical applications, including
healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and genomics.

    <title>A Comprehensive Overview and Comparative Analysis on Deep Learning
  Models: CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful subset of machine learning (ML)
and artificial intelligence (AI), outperforming traditional ML methods,
especially in handling unstructured and large datasets. Its impact spans across
various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles,
cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and
dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective
deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been
developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we
conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer
Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of
each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available
datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compare the performance of six renowned
deep learning models: CNN, Simple RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU.

    <title>Neural Machine Translation of Clinical Text: An Empirical Investigation
  into Multilingual Pre-Trained Language Models and Transfer-Learning</title>
    <summary>  We conduct investigations on clinical text machine translation by examining
multilingual neural network models using deep learning such as Transformer
based structures. Furthermore, to address the language resource imbalance
issue, we also carry out experiments using a transfer learning methodology
based on massive multilingual pre-trained language models (MMPLMs). The
experimental results on three subtasks including 1) clinical case (CC), 2)
clinical terminology (CT), and 3) ontological concept (OC) show that our models
achieved top-level performances in the ClinSpEn-2022 shared task on
English-Spanish clinical domain data. Furthermore, our expert-based human
evaluations demonstrate that the small-sized pre-trained language model (PLM)
won over the other two extra-large language models by a large margin, in the
clinical domain fine-tuning, which finding was never reported in the field.
Finally, the transfer learning method works well in our experimental setting
using the WMT21fb model to accommodate a new language space Spanish that was
not seen at the pre-training stage within WMT21fb itself, which deserves more
exploitation for clinical knowledge transformation, e.g. to investigate into
more languages. These research findings can shed some light on domain-specific
machine translation development, especially in clinical and healthcare fields.
Further research projects can be carried out based on our work to improve
healthcare text analytics and knowledge transformation. Our data will be openly
available for research purposes at https://github.com/HECTA-UoM/ClinicalNMT

de-identified data. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the
quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in
downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have
faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can
arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of
models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we
present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based
synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In
order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an
information-constrained Data Generation Process that enables the generator to
learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of
algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group
representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group
densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the
generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. We
conduct extensive experiments using the MIMIC-III database. Our results
demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves SOTA accuracy while significantly improving
fairness and minimizing bias amplification. We also perform an in-depth
explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity
of our study. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel and professional
approach to addressing the limitations of synthetic data generation in the
healthcare domain. By incorporating fairness considerations and leveraging
advanced techniques such as GANs, we pave the way for more reliable and
unbiased predictions in healthcare applications.

natural language processing (NLP) to analyze visual and textual medical data.
Our paper reviews recent advancements in developing VLMs specialized for
healthcare, focusing on models designed for medical report generation and
visual question answering (VQA). We provide background on NLP and CV,
explaining how techniques from both fields are integrated into VLMs to enable
learning from multimodal data. Key areas we address include the exploration of
medical vision-language datasets, in-depth analyses of architectures and
pre-training strategies employed in recent noteworthy medical VLMs, and
comprehensive discussion on evaluation metrics for assessing VLMs' performance
in medical report generation and VQA. We also highlight current challenges and
propose future directions, including enhancing clinical validity and addressing
patient privacy concerns. Overall, our review summarizes recent progress in
developing VLMs to harness multimodal medical data for improved healthcare
applications.

  Techniques: A Comprehensive Study</title>
    <summary>  Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative condition necessitating
early diagnosis for effective intervention. This paper introduces an innovative
method for diagnosing Parkinson's disease through the analysis of human EEG
signals, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model. this
research presents novel contributions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and
reliability. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive review of EEG signal
analysis techniques and machine learning methods. Drawing from recent studies,
we have engineered an advanced SVM-based model optimized for Parkinson's
disease diagnosis. Utilizing cutting-edge feature engineering, extensive
hyperparameter tuning, and kernel selection, our method achieves not only
heightened diagnostic accuracy but also emphasizes model interpretability,
catering to both clinicians and researchers. Moreover, ethical concerns in
healthcare machine learning, such as data privacy and biases, are
conscientiously addressed. We assess our method's performance through
experiments on a diverse dataset comprising EEG recordings from Parkinson's
disease patients and healthy controls, demonstrating significantly improved
diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional techniques. In conclusion, this
paper introduces an innovative SVM-based approach for diagnosing Parkinson's
disease from human EEG signals. Building upon the IEEE framework and previous
research, its novelty lies in the capacity to enhance diagnostic accuracy while
upholding interpretability and ethical considerations for practical healthcare
applications. These advances promise to revolutionize early Parkinson's disease
detection and management, ultimately contributing to enhanced patient outcomes
and quality of life.

    <title>A Brief Introduction to the Temporal Group LASSO and its Potential
  Applications in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The Temporal Group LASSO is an example of a multi-task, regularized
regression approach for the prediction of response variables that vary over
time. The aim of this work is to introduce the reader to the concepts behind
the Temporal Group LASSO and its related methods, as well as to the type of
potential applications in a healthcare setting that the method has. We argue
that the method is attractive because of its ability to reduce overfitting,
select predictors, learn smooth effect patterns over time, and finally, its
simplicity

    <title>Design of Experiments for Model Discrimination Hybridising Analytical
  and Data-Driven Approaches</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare companies must submit pharmaceutical drugs or medical devices to
regulatory bodies before marketing new technology. Regulatory bodies frequently
require transparent and interpretable computational modelling to justify a new
healthcare technology, but researchers may have several competing models for a
biological system and too little data to discriminate between the models. In
design of experiments for model discrimination, the goal is to design maximally
informative physical experiments in order to discriminate between rival
predictive models. Prior work has focused either on analytical approaches,
which cannot manage all functions, or on data-driven approaches, which may have
computational difficulties or lack interpretable marginal predictive
distributions. We develop a methodology introducing Gaussian process surrogates
in lieu of the original mechanistic models. We thereby extend existing design
and model discrimination methods developed for analytical models to cases of
non-analytical models in a computationally efficient manner.

    <title>Pre-screening breast cancer with machine learning and deep learning</title>
    <summary>  We suggest that deep learning can be used for pre-screening cancer by
analyzing demographic and anthropometric information of patients, as well as
biological markers obtained from routine blood samples and relative risks
obtained from meta-analysis and international databases. We applied feature
selection algorithms to a database of 116 women, including 52 healthy women and
64 women diagnosed with breast cancer, to identify the best pre-screening
predictors of cancer. We utilized the best predictors to perform k-fold Monte
Carlo cross-validation experiments that compare deep learning against
traditional machine learning algorithms. Our results indicate that a deep
learning model with an input-layer architecture that is fine-tuned using
feature selection can effectively distinguish between patients with and without
cancer. Additionally, compared to machine learning, deep learning has the
lowest uncertainty in its predictions. These findings suggest that deep
learning algorithms applied to cancer pre-screening offer a radiation-free,
non-invasive, and affordable complement to screening methods based on imagery.
The implementation of deep learning algorithms in cancer pre-screening offer
opportunities to identify individuals who may require imaging-based screening,
can encourage self-examination, and decrease the psychological externalities
associated with false positives in cancer screening. The integration of deep
learning algorithms for both screening and pre-screening will ultimately lead
to earlier detection of malignancy, reducing the healthcare and societal burden
associated to cancer treatment.

    <title>Privacy and Trust Redefined in Federated Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to
be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive
data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and
often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed
to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and
ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation
to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and
risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow
that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our
proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised
identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects
Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued
from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated
communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning
workflow related to mental health data.

    <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Dehydration in Afghan Children</title>
    <summary>  Child dehydration is a significant health concern, especially among children
under 5 years of age who are more susceptible to diarrhea and vomiting. In
Afghanistan, severe diarrhea contributes to child mortality due to dehydration.
However, there is no evidence of research exploring the potential of machine
learning techniques in diagnosing dehydration in Afghan children under five. To
fill this gap, this study leveraged various classifiers such as Random Forest,
Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, J48, and Logistic Regression to
develop a predictive model using a dataset of sick children retrieved from the
Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS). The primary objective was to
determine the dehydration status of children under 5 years. Among all the
classifiers, Random Forest proved to be the most effective, achieving an
accuracy of 91.46%, precision of 91%, and AUC of 94%. This model can
potentially assist healthcare professionals in promptly and accurately
identifying dehydration in under five children, leading to timely
interventions, and reducing the risk of severe health complications. Our study
demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in improving the
early diagnosis of dehydration in Afghan children.

    <title>Trends in Blockchain and Federated Learning for Data Sharing in
  Distributed Platforms</title>
    <summary>  With the development of communication technologies in 5G networks and the
Internet of things (IoT), a massive amount of generated data can improve
machine learning (ML) inference through data sharing. However, security and
privacy concerns are major obstacles in distributed and wireless networks. In
addition, IoT has a limitation on system resources depending on the purpose of
services. In addition, a blockchain technology enables secure transactions
among participants through consensus algorithms and encryption without a
centralized coordinator. In this paper, we first review the federated leaning
(FL) and blockchain mechanisms, and then, present a survey on the integration
of blockchain and FL for data sharing in industrial, vehicle, and healthcare
applications.

    <title>Care2Vec: A Deep learning approach for the classification of self-care
  problems in physically disabled children</title>
    <summary>  Accurate classification of self-care problems in children who suffer from
physical and motor affliction is an important problem in the healthcare
industry. This is a difficult and a time consumming process and it needs the
expertise of occupational therapists. In recent years, healthcare professionals
have opened up to the idea of using expert systems and artificial intelligence
in the diagnosis and classification of self care problems. In this study, we
propose a new deep learning based approach named Care2Vec for solving these
kind of problems and use a real world self care activities dataset that is
based on a conceptual framework designed by the World Health Organization
(WHO). Care2Vec is a mix of unsupervised and supervised learning where we use
Autoencoders and Deep neural networks as a two step modeling process. We found
that Care2Vec has a better prediction accuracy than some of the traditional
methods reported in the literature for solving the self care classification
problem viz. Decision trees and Artificial neural networks.

    <title>Learning from Two Decades of Blood Pressure Data: Demography-Specific
  Patterns Across 75 Million Patient Encounters</title>
    <summary>  Hypertension is a global health concern with an increasing prevalence,
underscoring the need for effective monitoring and analysis of blood pressure
(BP) dynamics. We analyzed a substantial BP dataset comprising 75,636,128
records from 2,054,462 unique patients collected between 2000 and 2022 at Emory
Healthcare in Georgia, USA, representing a demographically diverse population.
We examined and compared population-wide statistics of bivariate changes in
systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) across sex, age, and race/ethnicity.
The analysis revealed that males have higher BP levels than females and exhibit
a distinct BP profile with age. Notably, average SBP consistently rises with
age, whereas average DBP peaks in the forties age group. Among the ethnic
groups studied, Blacks have marginally higher BPs and a greater standard
deviation. We also discovered a significant correlation between SBP and DBP at
the population level, a phenomenon not previously researched. These results
emphasize the importance of demography-specific BP analysis for clinical
diagnosis and provide valuable insights for developing personalized,
demography-specific healthcare interventions.

    <title>Conformal Methods for Quantifying Uncertainty in Spatiotemporal Data: A
  Survey</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning methods are increasingly widely used in high-risk settings
such as healthcare, transportation, and finance. In these settings, it is
important that a model produces calibrated uncertainty to reflect its own
confidence and avoid failures. In this paper we survey recent works on
uncertainty quantification (UQ) for deep learning, in particular

    <title>Inferring Actual Treatment Pathways from Patient Records</title>
    <summary>  Treatment pathways are step-by-step plans outlining the recommended medical
care for specific diseases; they get revised when different treatments are
found to improve patient outcomes. Examining health records is an important
part of this revision process, but inferring patients' actual treatments from
health data is challenging due to complex event-coding schemes and the absence
of pathway-related annotations. This study aims to infer the actual treatment
steps for a particular patient group from administrative health records (AHR) -
a common form of tabular healthcare data - and address several technique- and
methodology-based gaps in treatment pathway-inference research. We introduce
Defrag, a method for examining AHRs to infer the real-world treatment steps for
a particular patient group. Defrag learns the semantic and temporal meaning of
healthcare event sequences, allowing it to reliably infer treatment steps from
complex healthcare data. To our knowledge, Defrag is the first
pathway-inference method to utilise a neural network (NN), an approach made
possible by a novel, self-supervised learning objective. We also developed a
testing and validation framework for pathway inference, which we use to
characterise and evaluate Defrag's pathway inference ability and compare
against baselines. We demonstrate Defrag's effectiveness by identifying
best-practice pathway fragments for breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma in
public healthcare records. Additionally, we use synthetic data experiments to
demonstrate the characteristics of the Defrag method, and to compare Defrag to
several baselines where it significantly outperforms non-NN-based methods.
Defrag significantly outperforms several existing pathway-inference methods and
offers an innovative and effective approach for inferring treatment pathways
from AHRs. Open-source code is provided to encourage further research in this
area.

    <title>A Machine Learning Early Warning System: Multicenter Validation in
  Brazilian Hospitals</title>
    <summary>  Early recognition of clinical deterioration is one of the main steps for
reducing inpatient morbidity and mortality. The challenging task of clinical
deterioration identification in hospitals lies in the intense daily routines of
healthcare practitioners, in the unconnected patient data stored in the
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and in the usage of low accuracy scores. Since
hospital wards are given less attention compared to the Intensive Care Unit,
ICU, we hypothesized that when a platform is connected to a stream of EHR,
there would be a drastic improvement in dangerous situations awareness and
could thus assist the healthcare team. With the application of machine
learning, the system is capable to consider all patient's history and through
the use of high-performing predictive models, an intelligent early warning
system is enabled. In this work we used 121,089 medical encounters from six
different hospitals and 7,540,389 data points, and we compared popular ward
protocols with six different scalable machine learning methods (three are
classic machine learning models, logistic and probabilistic-based models, and
three gradient boosted models). The results showed an advantage in AUC (Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 25 percentage points in
the best Machine Learning model result compared to the current state-of-the-art
protocols. This is shown by the generalization of the algorithm with
leave-one-group-out (AUC of 0.949) and the robustness through cross-validation
(AUC of 0.961). We also perform experiments to compare several window sizes to
justify the use of five patient timestamps. A sample dataset, experiments, and
code are available for replicability purposes.

    <title>COVID-19 Detection Based on Self-Supervised Transfer Learning Using
  Chest X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: Considering several patients screened due to COVID-19 pandemic,
computer-aided detection has strong potential in assisting clinical workflow
efficiency and reducing the incidence of infections among radiologists and
healthcare providers. Since many confirmed COVID-19 cases present radiological
findings of pneumonia, radiologic examinations can be useful for fast
detection. Therefore, chest radiography can be used to fast screen COVID-19
during the patient triage, thereby determining the priority of patient's care
to help saturated medical facilities in a pandemic situation. Methods: In this
paper, we propose a new learning scheme called self-supervised transfer
learning for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. We compared six
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (Cross, BYOL, SimSiam, SimCLR,
PIRL-jigsaw, and PIRL-rotation) with the proposed method. Additionally, we
compared six pretrained DCNNs (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, CheXNet,
DenseNet201, and InceptionV3) with the proposed method. We provide quantitative
evaluation on the largest open COVID-19 CXR dataset and qualitative results for
visual inspection. Results: Our method achieved a harmonic mean (HM) score of
0.985, AUC of 0.999, and four-class accuracy of 0.953. We also used the
visualization technique Grad-CAM++ to generate visual explanations of different
classes of CXR images with the proposed method to increase the
interpretability. Conclusions: Our method shows that the knowledge learned from
natural images using transfer learning is beneficial for SSL of the CXR images
and boosts the performance of representation learning for COVID-19 detection.
Our method promises to reduce the incidence of infections among radiologists
and healthcare providers.

    <title>Graph-Guided Network for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series</title>
    <summary>  In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time
series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive
readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different
time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds
irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the
dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every
sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between
sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor
graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations
to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural
network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing
time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time
series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity
datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4%
(absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular
sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows
superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.

    <title>Dissecting Medical Referral Mechanisms in Health Services: Role of
  Physician Professional Networks</title>
    <summary>  Medical referrals between primary care physicians (PC) and specialist care
(SC) physicians profoundly impact patient care regarding quality, satisfaction,
and cost. This paper investigates the influence of professional networks among
medical doctors on referring patients from PC to SC. Using five-year
consultation data from a Portuguese private health provider, we conducted
exploratory data analysis and constructed both professional and referral
networks among physicians. We then apply Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to
learn latent representations of the referral network. Our analysis supports the
hypothesis that doctors' professional social connections can predict medical
referrals, potentially enhancing collaboration within organizations and
improving healthcare services. This research contributes to dissecting the
underlying mechanisms in primary-specialty referrals, thereby providing
valuable insights for enhancing patient care and effective healthcare
management.

    <title>Medformer: A Multi-Granularity Patching Transformer for Medical
  Time-Series Classification</title>
    <summary>  Medical time series data, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and
Electrocardiography (ECG), play a crucial role in healthcare, such as
diagnosing brain and heart diseases. Existing methods for medical time series
classification primarily rely on handcrafted biomarkers extraction and
CNN-based models, with limited exploration of transformers tailored for medical
time series. In this paper, we introduce Medformer, a multi-granularity
patching transformer tailored specifically for medical time series
classification. Our method incorporates three novel mechanisms to leverage the
unique characteristics of medical time series: cross-channel patching to
leverage inter-channel correlations, multi-granularity embedding for capturing
features at different scales, and two-stage (intra- and inter-granularity)
multi-granularity self-attention for learning features and correlations within
and among granularities. We conduct extensive experiments on five public
datasets under both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent
setups. Results demonstrate Medformer's superiority over 10 baselines,
achieving top averaged ranking across five datasets on all six evaluation
metrics. These findings underscore the significant impact of our method on
healthcare applications, such as diagnosing Myocardial Infarction, Alzheimer's,
and Parkinson's disease. We release the source code at

    <title>L-SFAN: Lightweight Spatially-focused Attention Network for Pain
  Behavior Detection</title>
    <summary>  Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) afflicts millions globally, significantly
impacting individuals' well-being and imposing economic burdens on healthcare
systems. While artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning offer promising
avenues for analyzing pain-related behaviors to improve rehabilitation
strategies, current models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
recurrent neural networks, and graph-based neural networks, have limitations.
These approaches often focus singularly on the temporal dimension or require
complex architectures to exploit spatial interrelationships within multivariate
time series data. To address these limitations, we introduce \hbox{L-SFAN}, a
lightweight CNN architecture incorporating 2D filters designed to meticulously
capture the spatial-temporal interplay of data from motion capture and surface
electromyography sensors. Our proposed model, enhanced with an oriented global
pooling layer and multi-head self-attention mechanism, prioritizes critical
features to better understand CLBP and achieves competitive classification
accuracy. Experimental results on the EmoPain database demonstrate that our
approach not only enhances performance metrics with significantly fewer
parameters but also promotes model interpretability, offering valuable insights
for clinicians in managing CLBP. This advancement underscores the potential of
AI in transforming healthcare practices for chronic conditions like CLBP,
providing a sophisticated framework for the nuanced analysis of complex
biomedical data.

    <title>CPAS: the UK's National Machine Learning-based Hospital Capacity
  Planning System for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic poses the threat of
overwhelming healthcare systems with unprecedented demands for intensive care
resources. Managing these demands cannot be effectively conducted without a
nationwide collective effort that relies on data to forecast hospital demands
on the national, regional, hospital and individual levels. To this end, we
developed the COVID-19 Capacity Planning and Analysis System (CPAS) - a machine
learning-based system for hospital resource planning that we have successfully
deployed at individual hospitals and across regions in the UK in coordination
with NHS Digital. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of deploying a
machine learning-based decision support system at national scale, and explain
how CPAS addresses these challenges by (1) defining the appropriate learning
problem, (2) combining bottom-up and top-down analytical approaches, (3) using
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, (4) integrating heterogeneous
data sources, and (5) presenting the result with an interactive and transparent
interface. CPAS is one of the first machine learning-based systems to be
deployed in hospitals on a national scale to address the COVID-19 pandemic - we
conclude the paper with a summary of the lessons learned from this experience.

    <title>Model-Agnostic Interpretation Framework in Machine Learning: A
  Comparative Study in NBA Sports</title>
    <summary>  The field of machine learning has seen tremendous progress in recent years,
with deep learning models delivering exceptional performance across a range of
tasks. However, these models often come at the cost of interpretability, as
they operate as opaque "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind their
decisions. This lack of transparency can limit understanding of the models'
underlying principles and impede their deployment in sensitive domains, such as
healthcare or finance. To address this challenge, our research team has
proposed an innovative framework designed to reconcile the trade-off between
model performance and interpretability. Our approach is centered around modular
operations on high-dimensional data, which enable end-to-end processing while
preserving interpretability. By fusing diverse interpretability techniques and
modularized data processing, our framework sheds light on the decision-making
processes of complex models without compromising their performance. We have
extensively tested our framework and validated its superior efficacy in
achieving a harmonious balance between computational efficiency and
interpretability. Our approach addresses a critical need in contemporary
machine learning applications by providing unprecedented insights into the
inner workings of complex models, fostering trust, transparency, and
accountability in their deployment across diverse domains.

    <title>Big Data Analytics and AI in Mental Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Mental health conditions cause a great deal of distress or impairment;
depression alone will affect 11% of the world's population. The application of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big-data technologies to mental health has
great potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognosticating,
monitoring for relapse, detecting and helping to prevent mental health
conditions before they reach clinical-level symptomatology, and even delivering
some treatments. However, unlike similar applications in other fields of
medicine, there are several unique challenges in mental health applications
which currently pose barriers towards the implementation of these technologies.
Specifically, there are very few widely used or validated biomarkers in mental
health, leading to a heavy reliance on patient and clinician derived
questionnaire data as well as interpretation of new signals such as digital
phenotyping. In addition, diagnosis also lacks the same objective 'gold
standard' as in other conditions such as oncology, where clinicians and
researchers can often rely on pathological analysis for confirmation of
diagnosis. In this chapter we discuss the major opportunities, limitations and
techniques used for improving mental healthcare through AI and big-data. We
explore both the computational, clinical and ethical considerations and best
practices as well as lay out the major researcher directions for the near
future.

    <title>A Weighted Solution to SVM Actionability and Interpretability</title>
    <summary>  Research in machine learning has successfully developed algorithms to build
accurate classification models. However, in many real-world applications, such
as healthcare, customer satisfaction, and environment protection, we want to be
able to use the models to decide what actions to take.
  We investigate the concept of actionability in the context of Support Vector
Machines. Actionability is as important as interpretability or explainability
of machine learning models, an ongoing and important research topic.
Actionability is the task that gives us ways to act upon machine learning
models and their predictions.
  This paper finds a solution to the question of actionability on both linear
and non-linear SVM models. Additionally, we introduce a way to account for
weighted actions that allow for more change in certain features than others. We
propose a gradient descent solution on the linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels,
and we test the effectiveness of our models on both synthetic and real
datasets. We are also able to explore the model's interpretability through the
lens of actionability.

    <title>Robust Active Learning for Electrocardiographic Signal Classification</title>
    <summary>  The classification of electrocardiographic (ECG) signals is a challenging
problem for healthcare industry. Traditional supervised learning methods
require a large number of labeled data which is usually expensive and difficult
to obtain for ECG signals. Active learning is well-suited for ECG signal
classification as it aims at selecting the best set of labeled data in order to
maximize the classification performance. Motivated by the fact that ECG data
are usually heavily unbalanced among different classes and the class labels are
noisy as they are manually labeled, this paper proposes a novel solution based
on robust active learning for addressing these challenges. The key idea is to
first apply the clustering of the data in a low dimensional embedded space and
then select the most information instances within local clusters. By selecting
the most informative instances relying on local average minimal distances, the
algorithm tends to select the data for labelling in a more diversified way.
Finally, the robustness of the model is further enhanced by adding a novel
noisy label reduction scheme after the selection of the labeled data.
Experiments on the ECG signal classification from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia
database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

    <title>Learning continuous-valued treatment effects through representation
  balancing</title>
    <summary>  Estimating the effects of treatments with an associated dose on an instance's
outcome, the "dose response", is relevant in a variety of domains, from
healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as
continuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational
data, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the
allocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have
shown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate
individual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection
bias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to
estimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced
representation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued
treatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a
continuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed
benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learn
treatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respect
to other state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>Estimating Uncertainty and Interpretability in Deep Learning for
  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection</title>
    <summary>  Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging.
However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the
accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a
decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical
diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and
therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting
COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment.
However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet
inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights
based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in
Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the
human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and
show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of
prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning
solution will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a
clinical setting.

    <title>Relative Sparsity for Medical Decision Problems</title>
    <summary>  Existing statistical methods can estimate a policy, or a mapping from
covariates to decisions, which can then instruct decision makers (e.g., whether
to administer hypotension treatment based on covariates blood pressure and
heart rate). There is great interest in using such data-driven policies in
healthcare. However, it is often important to explain to the healthcare
provider, and to the patient, how a new policy differs from the current
standard of care. This end is facilitated if one can pinpoint the aspects of
the policy (i.e., the parameters for blood pressure and heart rate) that change
when moving from the standard of care to the new, suggested policy. To this
end, we adapt ideas from Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). In our work,
however, unlike in TRPO, the difference between the suggested policy and
standard of care is required to be sparse, aiding with interpretability. This
yields ``relative sparsity," where, as a function of a tuning parameter,
$\lambda$, we can approximately control the number of parameters in our
suggested policy that differ from their counterparts in the standard of care
(e.g., heart rate only). We propose a criterion for selecting $\lambda$,
perform simulations, and illustrate our method with a real, observational
healthcare dataset, deriving a policy that is easy to explain in the context of
the current standard of care. Our work promotes the adoption of data-driven
decision aids, which have great potential to improve health outcomes.

    <title>CheX-Nomaly: Segmenting Lung Abnormalities from Chest Radiographs using
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  The global challenge in chest radiograph X-ray (CXR) abnormalities often
being misdiagnosed is primarily associated with perceptual errors, where
healthcare providers struggle to accurately identify the location of
abnormalities, rather than misclassification errors. We currently address this
problem through disease-specific segmentation models. Unfortunately, these
models cannot be released in the field due to their lack of generalizability
across all thoracic diseases. A binary model tends to perform poorly when it
encounters a disease that isn't represented in the dataset. We present
CheX-nomaly: a binary localization U-net model that leverages transfer learning
techniques with the incorporation of an innovative contrastive learning
approach. Trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset, which encompasses 14 distinct
diseases in addition to 'no finding' cases, my model achieves generalizability
across these 14 diseases and others it has not seen before. We show that we can
significantly improve the generalizability of an abnormality localization model
by incorporating a contrastive learning method and dissociating the bounding
boxes with its disease class. We also introduce a new loss technique to apply
to enhance the U-nets performance on bounding box segmentation. By introducing
CheX-nomaly, we offer a promising solution to enhance the precision of chest
disease diagnosis, with a specific focus on reducing the significant number of
perceptual errors in healthcare.

    <title>Integrating ChatGPT into Secure Hospital Networks: A Case Study on
  Improving Radiology Report Analysis</title>
    <summary>  This study demonstrates the first in-hospital adaptation of a cloud-based AI,
similar to ChatGPT, into a secure model for analyzing radiology reports,
prioritizing patient data privacy. By employing a unique sentence-level
knowledge distillation method through contrastive learning, we achieve over 95%
accuracy in detecting anomalies. The model also accurately flags uncertainties
in its predictions, enhancing its reliability and interpretability for
physicians with certainty indicators. These advancements represent significant
progress in developing secure and efficient AI tools for healthcare, suggesting
a promising future for in-hospital AI applications with minimal supervision.

    <title>FedILC: Weighted Geometric Mean and Invariant Gradient Covariance for
  Federated Learning on Non-IID Data</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach which enables a
shared server model to learn by aggregating the locally-computed parameter
updates with the training data from spatially-distributed client silos. Though
successfully possessing advantages in both scale and privacy, federated
learning is hurt by domain shift problems, where the learning models are unable
to generalize to unseen domains whose data distribution is non-i.i.d. with
respect to the training domains. In this study, we propose the Federated
Invariant Learning Consistency (FedILC) approach, which leverages the gradient
covariance and the geometric mean of Hessians to capture both inter-silo and
intra-silo consistencies of environments and unravel the domain shift problems
in federated networks. The benchmark and real-world dataset experiments bring
evidence that our proposed algorithm outperforms conventional baselines and
similar federated learning algorithms. This is relevant to various fields such
as medical healthcare, computer vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The
code is released at https://github.com/mikemikezhu/FedILC.

    <title>Pre-training of Graph Augmented Transformers for Medication
  Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is
commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works
only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number
of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a
single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such
as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process.
To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the
power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and
medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical
structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a
transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only
with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then
fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients
with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model
pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the medication recommendation task.

    <title>Transfer Learning for Clinical Time Series Analysis using Deep Neural
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks have shown promising results for various clinical
prediction tasks. However, training deep networks such as those based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) requires large labeled data, significant
hyper-parameter tuning effort and expertise, and high computational resources.
In this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address
these issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series.
We consider two scenarios for transfer learning using RNNs: i)
domain-adaptation, i.e., leveraging a deep RNN - namely, TimeNet - pre-trained
for feature extraction on time series from diverse domains, and adapting it for
feature extraction and subsequent target tasks in healthcare domain, ii)
task-adaptation, i.e., pre-training a deep RNN - namely, HealthNet - on diverse
tasks in healthcare domain, and adapting it to new target tasks in the same
domain. We evaluate the above approaches on publicly available MIMIC-III
benchmark dataset, and demonstrate that (a) computationally-efficient linear
models trained using features extracted via pre-trained RNNs outperform or, in
the worst case, perform as well as deep RNNs and statistical hand-crafted
features based models trained specifically for target task; (b) models obtained
by adapting pre-trained models for target tasks are significantly more robust
to the size of labeled data compared to task-specific RNNs, while also being
computationally efficient. We, therefore, conclude that pre-trained deep models
like TimeNet and HealthNet allow leveraging the advantages of deep learning for
clinical time series analysis tasks, while also minimize dependence on
hand-crafted features, deal robustly with scarce labeled training data
scenarios without overfitting, as well as reduce dependence on expertise and
resources required to train deep networks from scratch.

    <title>Deep Survival Machines: Fully Parametric Survival Regression and
  Representation Learning for Censored Data with Competing Risks</title>
    <summary>  We describe a new approach to estimating relative risks in time-to-event
prediction problems with censored data in a fully parametric manner. Our
approach does not require making strong assumptions of constant proportional
hazard of the underlying survival distribution, as required by the
Cox-proportional hazard model. By jointly learning deep nonlinear
representations of the input covariates, we demonstrate the benefits of our
approach when used to estimate survival risks through extensive experimentation
on multiple real world datasets with different levels of censoring. We further
demonstrate advantages of our model in the competing risks scenario. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work involving fully parametric
estimation of survival times with competing risks in the presence of censoring.

    <title>Evaluating Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in Critical
  Infrastructures: A Case Study on Time-Series Classification</title>
    <summary>  With the advent of machine learning in applications of critical
infrastructure such as healthcare and energy, privacy is a growing concern in
the minds of stakeholders. It is pivotal to ensure that neither the model nor
the data can be used to extract sensitive information used by attackers against
individuals or to harm whole societies through the exploitation of critical
infrastructure. The applicability of machine learning in these domains is
mostly limited due to a lack of trust regarding the transparency and the
privacy constraints. Various safety-critical use cases (mostly relying on
time-series data) are currently underrepresented in privacy-related
considerations. By evaluating several privacy-preserving methods regarding
their applicability on time-series data, we validated the inefficacy of
encryption for deep learning, the strong dataset dependence of differential
privacy, and the broad applicability of federated methods.

    <title>Automated Detection of Persistent Inflammatory Biomarkers in
  Post-COVID-19 Patients Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impact on individuals, with many
experiencing persistent symptoms, including inflammation, in the post-acute
phase of the disease. Detecting and monitoring these inflammatory biomarkers is
critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study
employs machine learning techniques to automate the identification of
persistent inflammatory biomarkers in 290 post-COVID-19 patients, based on
medical data collected from hospitals in Iraq. The data encompassed a wide
array of clinical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6
levels, patient demographics, comorbidities, and treatment histories. Rigorous
data preprocessing and feature selection processes were implemented to optimize
the dataset for machine learning analysis. Various machine learning algorithms,
including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and
gradient boosting, were deployed to construct predictive models. These models
exhibited promising results, showcasing high accuracy and precision in the
identification of patients with persistent inflammation. The findings of this
study underscore the potential of machine learning in automating the detection
of persistent inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients. These models
can serve as valuable tools for healthcare providers, facilitating early
diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for individuals at risk of
persistent inflammation, ultimately contributing to improved post-acute
COVID-19 care and patient well-being. Keywords: COVID-19, post-COVID-19,
inflammation, biomarkers, machine learning, early detection.

    <title>Differential Privacy-enabled Federated Learning for Sensitive Health
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Leveraging real-world health data for machine learning tasks requires
addressing many practical challenges, such as distributed data silos, privacy
concerns with creating a centralized database from person-specific sensitive
data, resource constraints for transferring and integrating data from multiple
sites, and risk of a single point of failure. In this paper, we introduce a
federated learning framework that can learn a global model from distributed
health data held locally at different sites. The framework offers two levels of
privacy protection. First, it does not move or share raw data across sites or
with a centralized server during the model training process. Second, it uses a
differential privacy mechanism to further protect the model from potential
privacy attacks. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our approach on two
healthcare applications, using real-world electronic health data of 1 million
patients. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the federated
learning framework in offering an elevated level of privacy and maintaining
utility of the global model.

    <title>BoostTree and BoostForest for Ensemble Learning</title>
    <summary>  Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and boosting are two popular ensemble
learning approaches, which combine multiple base learners to generate a
composite model for more accurate and more reliable performance. They have been
widely used in biology, engineering, healthcare, etc. This paper proposes
BoostForest, which is an ensemble learning approach using BoostTree as base
learners and can be used for both classification and regression. BoostTree
constructs a tree model by gradient boosting. It increases the randomness
(diversity) by drawing the cut-points randomly at node splitting. BoostForest
further increases the randomness by bootstrapping the training data in
constructing different BoostTrees. BoostForest generally outperformed four
classical ensemble learning approaches (Random Forest, Extra-Trees, XGBoost and
LightGBM) on 35 classification and regression datasets. Remarkably, BoostForest
tunes its parameters by simply sampling them randomly from a parameter pool,
which can be easily specified, and its ensemble learning framework can also be
used to combine many other base learners.

    <title>FedQNN: Federated Learning using Quantum Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning
(QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via
distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple
with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our
proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a
cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the
principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates
QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed
environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing.
Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied
datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility
and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86%
accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting
various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of
classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of
QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.

    <title>A Study on Overfitting in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Recent years have witnessed significant progresses in deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL). Empowered with large scale neural networks, carefully designed
architectures, novel training algorithms and massively parallel computing
devices, researchers are able to attack many challenging RL problems. However,
in machine learning, more training power comes with a potential risk of more
overfitting. As deep RL techniques are being applied to critical problems such
as healthcare and finance, it is important to understand the generalization
behaviors of the trained agents. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study
of standard RL agents and find that they could overfit in various ways.
Moreover, overfitting could happen "robustly": commonly used techniques in RL
that add stochasticity do not necessarily prevent or detect overfitting. In
particular, the same agents and learning algorithms could have drastically
different test performance, even when all of them achieve optimal rewards
during training. The observations call for more principled and careful
evaluation protocols in RL. We conclude with a general discussion on
overfitting in RL and a study of the generalization behaviors from the
perspective of inductive bias.

    <title>Fast, Structured Clinical Documentation via Contextual Autocomplete</title>
    <summary>  We present a system that uses a learned autocompletion mechanism to
facilitate rapid creation of semi-structured clinical documentation. We
dynamically suggest relevant clinical concepts as a doctor drafts a note by
leveraging features from both unstructured and structured medical data. By
constraining our architecture to shallow neural networks, we are able to make
these suggestions in real time. Furthermore, as our algorithm is used to write
a note, we can automatically annotate the documentation with clean labels of
clinical concepts drawn from medical vocabularies, making notes more structured
and readable for physicians, patients, and future algorithms. To our knowledge,
this system is the only machine learning-based documentation utility for
clinical notes deployed in a live hospital setting, and it reduces keystroke
burden of clinical concepts by 67% in real environments.

    <title>Learning Insulin-Glucose Dynamics in the Wild</title>
    <summary>  We develop a new model of insulin-glucose dynamics for forecasting blood
glucose in type 1 diabetics. We augment an existing biomedical model by
introducing time-varying dynamics driven by a machine learning sequence model.
Our model maintains a physiologically plausible inductive bias and clinically
interpretable parameters -- e.g., insulin sensitivity -- while inheriting the
flexibility of modern pattern recognition algorithms. Critical to modeling
success are the flexible, but structured representations of subject variability
with a sequence model. In contrast, less constrained models like the LSTM fail
to provide reliable or physiologically plausible forecasts. We conduct an
extensive empirical study. We show that allowing biomedical model dynamics to
vary in time improves forecasting at long time horizons, up to six hours, and
produces forecasts consistent with the physiological effects of insulin and
carbohydrates.

    <title>Cardea: An Open Automated Machine Learning Framework for Electronic
  Health Records</title>
    <summary>  An estimated 180 papers focusing on deep learning and EHR were published
between 2010 and 2018. Despite the common workflow structure appearing in these
publications, no trusted and verified software framework exists, forcing
researchers to arduously repeat previous work. In this paper, we propose
Cardea, an extensible open-source automated machine learning framework
encapsulating common prediction problems in the health domain and allows users
to build predictive models with their own data. This system relies on two
components: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) -- a standardized
data structure for electronic health systems -- and several AUTOML frameworks
for automated feature engineering, model selection, and tuning. We augment
these components with an adaptive data assembler and comprehensive data- and
model- auditing capabilities. We demonstrate our framework via 5 prediction
tasks on MIMIC-III and Kaggle datasets, which highlight Cardea's human
competitiveness, flexibility in problem definition, extensive feature
generation capability, adaptable automatic data assembler, and its usability.

    <title>A Survey on the Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction and
  Diagnosis of Schizophrenia</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning is employed in healthcare to draw approximate conclusions
regarding human diseases and mental health problems. Compared to older
traditional methods, it can help to analyze data more efficiently and produce
better and more dependable results. Millions of people are affected by
schizophrenia, which is a chronic mental disorder that can significantly impact
their lives. Many machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict
and prevent this disease, and they can potentially be implemented in the
diagnosis of individuals who have it. This survey aims to review papers that
have focused on the use of deep learning to detect and predict schizophrenia
using EEG signals, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). With our chosen search strategy, we assessed
ten publications from 2019 to 2022. All studies achieved successful predictions
of more than 80%. This review provides summaries of the studies and compares
their notable aspects. In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML) for schizophrenia, significant advances have been made due to the
availability of ML tools, and we are optimistic that this field will continue
to grow.

    <title>PAC Prediction Sets for Meta-Learning</title>
    <summary>  Uncertainty quantification is a key component of machine learning models
targeted at safety-critical systems such as in healthcare or autonomous
vehicles. We study this problem in the context of meta learning, where the goal
is to quickly adapt a predictor to new tasks. In particular, we propose a novel
algorithm to construct \emph{PAC prediction sets}, which capture uncertainty
via sets of labels, that can be adapted to new tasks with only a few training
examples. These prediction sets satisfy an extension of the typical PAC
guarantee to the meta learning setting; in particular, the PAC guarantee holds
with high probability over future tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on four datasets across three application domains: mini-ImageNet and
CIFAR10-C in the visual domain, FewRel in the language domain, and the CDC
Heart Dataset in the medical domain. In particular, our prediction sets satisfy
the PAC guarantee while having smaller size compared to other baselines that
also satisfy this guarantee.

    <title>When Healthcare Meets Off-the-Shelf WiFi: A Non-Wearable and Low-Costs
  Approach for In-Home Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  As elderly population grows, social and health care begin to face validation
challenges, in-home monitoring is becoming a focus for professionals in the
field. Governments urgently need to improve the quality of healthcare services
at lower costs while ensuring the comfort and independence of the elderly. This
work presents an in-home monitoring approach based on off-the-shelf WiFi, which
is low-costs, non-wearable and makes all-round daily healthcare information
available to caregivers. The proposed approach can capture fine-grained human
pose figures even through a wall and track detailed respiration status
simultaneously by off-the-shelf WiFi devices. Based on them, behavioral data,
physiological data and the derived information (e.g., abnormal events and
underlying diseases), of the elderly could be seen by caregivers directly. We
design a series of signal processing methods and a neural network to capture
human pose figures and extract respiration status curves from WiFi Channel
State Information (CSI). Extensive experiments are conducted and according to
the results, off-the-shelf WiFi devices are capable of capturing fine-grained
human pose figures, similar to cameras, even through a wall and track accurate
respiration status, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our
approach for in-home monitoring.

    <title>Explainable AI for clinical and remote health applications: a survey on
  tabular and time series data</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of
healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI
systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions
and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive
and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same
attention across different research areas and data types, especially in
healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are
based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly
analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI
methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the
healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5
years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided
to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical
validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality
evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure
effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main
research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI
methods.

    <title>SpecHD: Hyperdimensional Computing Framework for FPGA-based Mass
  Spectrometry Clustering</title>
    <summary>  Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a key enabler for personalized
healthcare, providing a deep dive into the complex protein compositions of
biological systems. This technology has vast applications in biotechnology and
biomedicine but faces significant computational bottlenecks. Current
methodologies often require multiple hours or even days to process extensive
datasets, particularly in the domain of spectral clustering. To tackle these
inefficiencies, we introduce SpecHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC)
framework supplemented by an FPGA-accelerated architecture with integrated
near-storage preprocessing. Utilizing streamlined binary operations in an HDC
environment, SpecHD capitalizes on the low-latency and parallel capabilities of
FPGAs. This approach markedly improves clustering speed and efficiency, serving
as a catalyst for real-time, high-throughput data analysis in future healthcare
applications. Our evaluations demonstrate that SpecHD not only maintains but
often surpasses existing clustering quality metrics while drastically cutting
computational time. Specifically, it can cluster a large-scale human proteome
dataset-comprising 25 million MS/MS spectra and 131 GB of MS data-in just 5
minutes. With energy efficiency exceeding 31x and a speedup factor that spans a
range of 6x to 54x over existing state of-the-art solutions, SpecHD emerges as
a promising solution for the rapid analysis of mass spectrometry data with
great implications for personalized healthcare.

    <title>GPT-4's assessment of its performance in a USMLE-based case study</title>
    <summary>  This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare
applications. A simple prompting technique was used to prompt the LLM with
questions taken from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)
questionnaire and it was tasked to evaluate its confidence score before posing
the question and after asking the question. The questionnaire was categorized
into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF)
post-question. The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence
scores before and after each question. The experimental findings were analyzed
using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF
groups. Additionally, a sequential analysis was conducted to observe the
performance variation for the WF and NF groups. Results indicate that feedback
influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease
it. Understanding the performance of LLM is paramount in exploring its utility
in sensitive areas like healthcare. This study contributes to the ongoing
discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within
healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized
to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.

    <title>Performance and utility trade-off in interpretable sleep staging</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of models
approaching the human level of accuracy. However, healthcare remains an area
lacking in widespread adoption. The safety-critical nature of healthcare
results in a natural reticence to put these black-box deep learning models into
practice. This paper explores interpretable methods for a clinical decision
support system called sleep staging, an essential step in diagnosing sleep
disorders. Clinical sleep staging is an arduous process requiring manual
annotation for each 30s of sleep using physiological signals such as
electroencephalogram (EEG). Recent work has shown that sleep staging using
simple models and an exhaustive set of features can perform nearly as well as
deep learning approaches but only for some specific datasets. Moreover, the
utility of those features from a clinical standpoint is ambiguous. On the other
hand, the proposed framework, NormIntSleep demonstrates exceptional performance
across different datasets by representing deep learning embeddings using
normalized features. NormIntSleep performs 4.5% better than the exhaustive
feature-based approach and 1.5% better than other representation learning
approaches. An empirical comparison between the utility of the interpretations
of these models highlights the improved alignment with clinical expectations
when performance is traded-off slightly. NormIntSleep paired with a clinically
meaningful set of features can best balance this trade-off by providing
reliable, clinically relevant interpretation with robust performance.

    <title>HGV4Risk: Hierarchical Global View-guided Sequence Representation
  Learning for Risk Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Risk prediction, as a typical time series modeling problem, is usually
achieved by learning trends in markers or historical behavior from sequence
data, and has been widely applied in healthcare and finance. In recent years,
deep learning models, especially Long Short-Term Memory neural networks
(LSTMs), have led to superior performances in such sequence representation
learning tasks. Despite that some attention or self-attention based models with
time-aware or feature-aware enhanced strategies have achieved better
performance compared with other temporal modeling methods, such improvement is
limited due to a lack of guidance from global view. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end Hierarchical Global View-guided (HGV) sequence
representation learning framework. Specifically, the Global Graph Embedding
(GGE) module is proposed to learn sequential clip-aware representations from
temporal correlation graph at instance level. Furthermore, following the way of
key-query attention, the harmonic $\beta$-attention ($\beta$-Attn) is also
developed for making a global trade-off between time-aware decay and
observation significance at channel level adaptively. Moreover, the
hierarchical representations at both instance level and channel level can be
coordinated by the heterogeneous information aggregation under the guidance of
global view. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset for healthcare risk
prediction, and a real-world industrial scenario for Small and Mid-size
Enterprises (SMEs) credit overdue risk prediction in MYBank, Ant Group, have
illustrated that the proposed model can achieve competitive prediction
performance compared with other known baselines.

    <summary>  Ensemble learning is widely applied in Machine Learning (ML) to improve model
performance and to mitigate decision risks. In this approach, predictions from
a diverse set of learners are combined to obtain a joint decision. Recently,
various methods have been explored in literature for estimating decision
uncertainties using ensemble learning; however, determining which metrics are a
better fit for certain decision-making applications remains a challenging task.
In this paper, we study the following key research question in the selection of
uncertainty metrics: when does an uncertainty metric outperforms another? We
answer this question via a rigorous analysis of two commonly used uncertainty
metrics in ensemble learning, namely ensemble mean and ensemble variance. We
show that, under mild assumptions on the ensemble learners, ensemble mean is
preferable with respect to ensemble variance as an uncertainty metric for
decision making. We empirically validate our assumptions and theoretical
results via an extensive case study: the diagnosis of referable diabetic
retinopathy.

    <title>Learning to Exploit Invariances in Clinical Time-Series Data using
  Sequence Transformer Networks</title>
    <summary>  Recently, researchers have started applying convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with one-dimensional convolutions to clinical tasks involving
time-series data. This is due, in part, to their computational efficiency,
relative to recurrent neural networks and their ability to efficiently exploit
certain temporal invariances, (e.g., phase invariance). However, it is
well-established that clinical data may exhibit many other types of invariances
(e.g., scaling). While preprocessing techniques, (e.g., dynamic time warping)
may successfully transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to
identify the types of invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use
of Sequence Transformer Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that
learns to identify and account for invariances in clinical time-series data.
Applied to the task of predicting in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach
achieves an improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) relative to a baseline CNN (AUROC=0.851 vs. AUROC=0.838). Our
results suggest that a variety of valuable invariances can be learned directly
from the data.

    <title>Towards Fair and Privacy Preserving Federated Learning for the
  Healthcare Domain</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning enables data sharing in healthcare contexts where it might
otherwise be difficult due to data-use-ordinances or security and communication
constraints. Distributed and shared data models allow models to become
generalizable and learn from heterogeneous clients. While addressing data
security, privacy, and vulnerability considerations, data itself is not shared
across nodes in a given learning network. On the other hand, FL models often
struggle with variable client data distributions and operate on an assumption
of independent and identically distributed data. As the field has grown, the
notion of fairness-aware federated learning mechanisms has also been introduced
and is of distinct significance to the healthcare domain where many sensitive
groups and protected classes exist. In this paper, we create a benchmark
methodology for FAFL mechanisms under various heterogeneous conditions on
datasets in the healthcare domain typically outside the scope of current
federated learning benchmarks, such as medical imaging and waveform data
formats. Our results indicate considerable variation in how various FAFL
schemes respond to high levels of data heterogeneity. Additionally, doing so
under privacy-preserving conditions can create significant increases in network
communication cost and latency compared to the typical federated learning
scheme.

    <title>Privacy-Preserving Wavelet Neural Network with Fully Homomorphic
  Encryption</title>
    <summary>  The main aim of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) is to protect the
privacy and provide security to the data used in building Machine Learning
models. There are various techniques in PPML such as Secure Multi-Party
Computation, Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The
techniques are combined with various Machine Learning models and even Deep
Learning Networks to protect the data privacy as well as the identity of the
user. In this paper, we propose a fully homomorphic encrypted wavelet neural
network to protect privacy and at the same time not compromise on the
efficiency of the model. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed method on
seven datasets taken from the finance and healthcare domains. The results show
that our proposed model performs similarly to the unencrypted model.

    <title>Multitask learning and benchmarking with clinical time series data</title>
    <summary>  Health care is one of the most exciting frontiers in data mining and machine
learning. Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an
explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in
machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because
of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this
problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from
the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)
database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling
risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline,
and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for
all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training
and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural
models.

    <title>Machine Learning on Electronic Health Records: Models and Features
  Usages to predict Medication Non-Adherence</title>
    <summary>  Adherence can be defined as "the extent to which patients take their
medications as prescribed by their healthcare providers"[Osterberg and
Blaschke, 2005]. World Health Organization's reports point out that, in
developed countries, only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases correctly
follow their treatments. This severely compromises the efficiency of long-term
therapy and increases the cost of health services. We propose in this paper
different models of patient drug consumption in breast cancer treatments. The
aim of these different approaches is to predict medication non-adherence while
giving insights to doctors of the underlying reasons of these illegitimate
drop-outs. Working with oncologists, we show the interest of Machine- Learning
algorithms fined tune by the feedback of experts to estimate a risk score of a
patient's non-adherence and thus improve support throughout their care path.

    <title>CLUE: A Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation for LLMs</title>
    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to
patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical
LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands
and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this
sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, evaluation has
primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the
complexity of practical clinical applications. To fill this gap, we present the
Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to
evaluate LLMs on clinical tasks. CLUE includes six tasks to test the practical
applicability of LLMs in complex healthcare settings. Our evaluation includes a
total of $25$ LLMs. In contrast to previous evaluations, CLUE shows a decrease
in performance for nine out of twelve biomedical models. Our benchmark
represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing
LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs
of clinical application. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets for
future research at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE.

    <title>AI Assisted Annotator using Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data suffers from both noise and lack of ground truth. The cost of
data increases as it is cleaned and annotated in healthcare. Unlike other data
sets, medical data annotation, which is critical to accurate ground truth,
requires medical domain expertise for a better patient outcome. In this work,
we report on the use of reinforcement learning to mimic the decision making
process of annotators for medical events, to automate annotation and labelling.
The reinforcement agent learns to annotate alarm data based on annotations done
by an expert. Our method shows promising results on medical alarm data sets. We
trained DQN and A2C agents using the data from monitoring devices annotated by
an expert. Initial results from these RL agents learning the expert annotation
behavior are promising. The A2C agent performs better in terms of learning the
sparse events in a given state, thereby choosing more right actions compared to
DQN agent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement
learning application for the automation of medical events annotation, which has
far-reaching practical use.

    <title>Cost-Sensitive Diagnosis and Learning Leveraging Public Health Data</title>
    <summary>  Traditionally, machine learning algorithms rely on the assumption that all
features of a given dataset are available for free. However, there are many
concerns such as monetary data collection costs, patient discomfort in medical
procedures, and privacy impacts of data collection that require careful
consideration in any real-world health analytics system. An efficient solution
would only acquire a subset of features based on the value it provides while
considering acquisition costs. Moreover, datasets that provide feature costs
are very limited, especially in healthcare. In this paper, we provide a health
dataset as well as a method for assigning feature costs based on the total
level of inconvenience asking for each feature entails. Furthermore, based on
the suggested dataset, we provide a comparison of recent and state-of-the-art
approaches to cost-sensitive feature acquisition and learning. Specifically, we
analyze the performance of major sensitivity-based and reinforcement learning
based methods in the literature on three different problems in the health
domain, including diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension classification.

    <title>Distributionally Robust Fair Principal Components via Geodesic Descents</title>
    <summary>  Principal component analysis is a simple yet useful dimensionality reduction
technique in modern machine learning pipelines. In consequential domains such
as college admission, healthcare and credit approval, it is imperative to take
into account emerging criteria such as the fairness and the robustness of the
learned projection. In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust
optimization problem for principal component analysis which internalizes a
fairness criterion in the objective function. The learned projection thus
balances the trade-off between the total reconstruction error and the
reconstruction error gap between subgroups, taken in the min-max sense over all
distributions in a moment-based ambiguity set. The resulting optimization
problem over the Stiefel manifold can be efficiently solved by a Riemannian
subgradient descent algorithm with a sub-linear convergence rate. Our
experimental results on real-world datasets show the merits of our proposed
method over state-of-the-art baselines.

    <title>Generating Synthetic Clinical Data that Capture Class Imbalanced
  Distributions with Generative Adversarial Networks: Example using
  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV</title>
    <summary>  Clinical data usually cannot be freely distributed due to their highly
confidential nature and this hampers the development of machine learning in the
healthcare domain. One way to mitigate this problem is by generating realistic
synthetic datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs
are known to suffer from mode collapse thus creating outputs of low diversity.
This lowers the quality of the synthetic healthcare data, and may cause it to
omit patients of minority demographics or neglect less common clinical
practices. In this paper, we extend the classic GAN setup with an additional
variational autoencoder (VAE) and include an external memory to replay latent
features observed from the real samples to the GAN generator. Using
antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (ART for HIV) as a case
study, we show that our extended setup overcomes mode collapse and generates a
synthetic dataset that accurately describes severely imbalanced class
distributions commonly found in real-world clinical variables. In addition, we
demonstrate that our synthetic dataset is associated with a very low patient
disclosure risk, and that it retains a high level of utility from the ground
truth dataset to support the development of downstream machine learning
algorithms.

    <title>Sequential Diagnosis Prediction with Transformer and Ontological
  Representation</title>
    <summary>  Sequential diagnosis prediction on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has
been proven crucial for predictive analytics in the medical domain. EHR data,
sequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has
numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data
insufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making
use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to
irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from
hospital, and insufficient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end
robust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary
differential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient's
visits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate
the limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to
capture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer
transformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets
show that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves
better predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches,
irrespective of sufficient or insufficient training data, but also derives more
interpretable embeddings of medical codes. The experimental codes are available
at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Xueping/SETOR).

    <title>A Review on Knowledge Graphs for Healthcare: Resources, Applications,
  and Promises</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare knowledge graphs (HKGs) are valuable tools for organizing
biomedical concepts and their relationships with interpretable structures. The
recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for building
more comprehensive and accurate HKGs. This, in turn, can improve the
reliability of generated content and enable better evaluation of LLMs. However,
the challenges of HKGs such as regarding data heterogeneity and limited
coverage are not fully understood, highlighting the need for detailed reviews.
This work provides the first comprehensive review of HKGs. It summarizes the
pipeline and key techniques for HKG construction, as well as the common
utilization approaches, i.e., model-free and model-based. The existing HKG
resources are also organized based on the data types they capture and
application domains they cover, along with relevant statistical information
(Resource available at
https://github.com/lujiaying/Awesome-HealthCare-KnowledgeBase). At the
application level, we delve into the successful integration of HKGs across
various health domains, ranging from fine-grained basic science research to
high-level clinical decision support and public health. Lastly, the paper
highlights the opportunities for HKGs in the era of LLMs. This work aims to
serve as a valuable resource for understanding the potential and opportunities
of HKG in health research.

    <title>More Efficient Policy Learning via Optimal Retargeting</title>
    <summary>  Policy learning can be used to extract individualized treatment regimes from
observational data in healthcare, civics, e-commerce, and beyond. One big
hurdle to policy learning is a commonplace lack of overlap in the data for
different actions, which can lead to unwieldy policy evaluation and poorly
performing learned policies. We study a solution to this problem based on
retargeting, that is, changing the population on which policies are optimized.
We first argue that at the population level, retargeting may induce little to
no bias. We then characterize the optimal reference policy and retargeting
weights in both binary-action and multi-action settings. We do this in terms of
the asymptotic efficient estimation variance of the new learning objective.
Extensive empirical results in a simulation study and a case study of
personalized job counseling demonstrate that retargeting is a fairly easy way
to significantly improve any policy learning procedure applied to observational
data.

    <title>Deep EHR: A Survey of Recent Advances in Deep Learning Techniques for
  Electronic Health Record (EHR) Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The past decade has seen an explosion in the amount of digital information
stored in electronic health records (EHR). While primarily designed for
archiving patient clinical information and administrative healthcare tasks,
many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical
informatics tasks. Over the same period, the machine learning community has
seen widespread advances in deep learning techniques, which also have been
successfully applied to the vast amount of EHR data. In this paper, we review
these deep EHR systems, examining architectures, technical aspects, and
clinical applications. We also identify shortcomings of current techniques and
discuss avenues of future research for EHR-based deep learning.

    <title>Nonparametric Universal Copula Modeling</title>
    <summary>  To handle the ubiquitous problem of "dependence learning," copulas are
quickly becoming a pervasive tool across a wide range of data-driven
disciplines encompassing neuroscience, finance, econometrics, genomics, social
science, machine learning, healthcare and many more. Copula (or connection)
functions were invented in 1959 by Abe Sklar in response to a query of Maurice
Frechet. After 60 years, where do we stand now? This article provides a history

    <title>The Hidden Adversarial Vulnerabilities of Medical Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we delve into the susceptibility of federated medical image
analysis systems to adversarial attacks. Our analysis uncovers a novel
exploitation avenue: using gradient information from prior global model
updates, adversaries can enhance the efficiency and transferability of their
attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that single-step attacks (e.g. FGSM),
when aptly initialized, can outperform the efficiency of their iterative
counterparts but with reduced computational demand. Our findings underscore the
need to revisit our understanding of AI security in federated healthcare
settings.

    <title>Impact of the composition of feature extraction and class sampling in
  medicare fraud detection</title>
    <summary>  With healthcare being critical aspect, health insurance has become an
important scheme in minimizing medical expenses. Following this, the healthcare
industry has seen a significant increase in fraudulent activities owing to
increased insurance, and fraud has become a significant contributor to rising
medical care expenses, although its impact can be mitigated using fraud
detection techniques. To detect fraud, machine learning techniques are used.
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) of the United States
federal government released "Medicare Part D" insurance claims is utilized in
this study to develop fraud detection system. Employing machine learning
algorithms on a class-imbalanced and high dimensional medicare dataset is a
challenging task. To compact such challenges, the present work aims to perform
feature extraction following data sampling, afterward applying various
classification algorithms, to get better performance. Feature extraction is a
dimensionality reduction approach that converts attributes into linear or
non-linear combinations of the actual attributes, generating a smaller and more
diversified set of attributes and thus reducing the dimensions. Data sampling
is commonlya used to address the class imbalance either by expanding the
frequency of minority class or reducing the frequency of majority class to
obtain approximately equal numbers of occurrences for both classes. The
proposed approach is evaluated through standard performance metrics. Thus, to
detect fraud efficiently, this study applies autoencoder as a feature
extraction technique, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) as a
data sampling technique, and various gradient boosted decision tree-based
classifiers as a classification algorithm. The experimental results show the
combination of autoencoders followed by SMOTE on the LightGBM classifier
achieved best results.

    <title>A Survey on Medical Large Language Models: Technology, Application,
  Trustworthiness, and Future Directions</title>
    <summary>  Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT series models, have received
substantial attention due to their impressive capabilities for generating and
understanding human-level language. More recently, LLMs have emerged as an
innovative and powerful adjunct in the medical field, transforming traditional
practices and heralding a new era of enhanced healthcare services. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs),
outlining their evolution from general to the medical-specific domain (i.e,
Technology and Application), as well as their transformative impact on
healthcare (e.g., Trustworthiness and Safety). Concretely, starting from the
fundamental history and technology of LLMs, we first delve into the progressive
adaptation and refinements of general LLM models in the medical domain,
especially emphasizing the advanced algorithms that boost the LLMs' performance
in handling complicated medical environments, including clinical reasoning,
knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation, human alignment, and
multi-modal learning. Secondly, we explore the extensive applications of
Med-LLMs across domains such as clinical decision support, report generation,
and medical education, illustrating their potential to streamline healthcare
services and augment patient outcomes. Finally, recognizing the imperative and
responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges of ensuring fairness,
accountability, privacy, and robustness in Med-LLMs applications. Finally, we
conduct a concise discussion for anticipating possible future trajectories of
Med-LLMs, identifying avenues for the prudent expansion of Med-LLMs. By
consolidating above-mentioned insights, this review seeks to provide a
comprehensive investigation of the potential strengths and limitations of
Med-LLMs for professionals and researchers, ensuring a responsible landscape in
the healthcare setting.

    <title>Detection of Myocardial Infarction Based on Novel Deep Transfer Learning
  Methods for Urban Healthcare in Smart Cities</title>
    <summary>  . In this paper, an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is
presented to detect MI signals using the convolution neural network (CNN) for
urban healthcare in smart cities. Two types of transfer learning techniques are
employed to retrain the pre-trained VGG-Net (Fine-tuning and VGG-Net as fixed
feature extractor) and obtained two new networks VGG-MI1 and VGG-MI2. In the
VGG-MI1 model, the last layer of the VGG-Net model is replaced with a specific
layer according to our requirements and various functions are optimized to
reduce overfitting. In the VGG-MI2 model, one layer of the VGG-Net model is
selected as a feature descriptor of the ECG images to describe it with
informative features. Considering the limited availability of dataset, ECG data
is augmented which has increased the classification performance.
Physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt (PTB) Diagnostic ECG database is used for
experimentation, which has been widely employed in MI detection studies. In
case of using VGG-MI1, we achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of
99.02%, 98.76%, and 99.17%, respectively and we achieved an accuracy of 99.22%,
a sensitivity of 99.15%, and a specificity of 99.49% with VGG-MI2 model.
Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed system in terms of
accuracy sensitivity, and specificity.

    <title>A Snapshot of the Frontiers of Client Selection in Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving approach in
distributed machine learning. A federated learning architecture consists of a
central server and a number of clients that have access to private, potentially
sensitive data. Clients are able to keep their data in their local machines and
only share their locally trained model's parameters with a central server that
manages the collaborative learning process. FL has delivered promising results
in real-life scenarios, such as healthcare, energy, and finance. However, when
the number of participating clients is large, the overhead of managing the
clients slows down the learning. Thus, client selection has been introduced as
a strategy to limit the number of communicating parties at every step of the
process. Since the early na\"{i}ve random selection of clients, several client
selection methods have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, given
that this is an emergent field, there is a lack of a taxonomy of client
selection methods, making it hard to compare approaches. In this paper, we
propose a taxonomy of client selection in Federated Learning that enables us to
shed light on current progress in the field and identify potential areas of
future research in this promising area of machine learning.

    <title>Explainable AI in Orthopedics: Challenges, Opportunities, and Prospects</title>
    <summary>  While artificial intelligence (AI) has made many successful applications in
various domains, its adoption in healthcare lags a little bit behind other
high-stakes settings. Several factors contribute to this slower uptake,
including regulatory frameworks, patient privacy concerns, and data
heterogeneity. However, one significant challenge that impedes the
implementation of AI in healthcare, particularly in orthopedics, is the lack of
explainability and interpretability around AI models. Addressing the challenge
of explainable AI (XAI) in orthopedics requires developing AI models and
algorithms that prioritize transparency and interpretability, allowing
clinicians, surgeons, and patients to understand the contributing factors
behind any AI-powered predictive or descriptive models. The current
contribution outlines several key challenges and opportunities that manifest in
XAI in orthopedic practice. This work emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary
collaborations between AI practitioners, orthopedic specialists, and regulatory
entities to establish standards and guidelines for the adoption of XAI in
orthopedics.

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning: Tutorial, Review, and Perspectives on
  Open Problems</title>
    <summary>  In this tutorial article, we aim to provide the reader with the conceptual
tools needed to get started on research on offline reinforcement learning
algorithms: reinforcement learning algorithms that utilize previously collected
data, without additional online data collection. Offline reinforcement learning
algorithms hold tremendous promise for making it possible to turn large
datasets into powerful decision making engines. Effective offline reinforcement
learning methods would be able to extract policies with the maximum possible
utility out of the available data, thereby allowing automation of a wide range
of decision-making domains, from healthcare and education to robotics. However,
the limitations of current algorithms make this difficult. We will aim to
provide the reader with an understanding of these challenges, particularly in
the context of modern deep reinforcement learning methods, and describe some
potential solutions that have been explored in recent work to mitigate these
challenges, along with recent applications, and a discussion of perspectives on
open problems in the field.

    <title>Resource-Efficient Deep Learning: A Survey on Model-, Arithmetic-, and
  Implementation-Level Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning is pervasive in our daily life, including self-driving cars,
virtual assistants, social network services, healthcare services, face
recognition, etc. However, deep neural networks demand substantial compute
resources during training and inference. The machine learning community has
mainly focused on model-level optimizations such as architectural compression
of deep learning models, while the system community has focused on
implementation-level optimization. In between, various arithmetic-level
optimization techniques have been proposed in the arithmetic community. This
article provides a survey on resource-efficient deep learning techniques in
terms of model-, arithmetic-, and implementation-level techniques and
identifies the research gaps for resource-efficient deep learning techniques
across the three different level techniques. Our survey clarifies the influence
from higher to lower-level techniques based on our resource-efficiency metric
definition and discusses the future trend for resource-efficient deep learning
research.

    <title>Predicting Diabetes Disease Evolution Using Financial Records and
  Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Managing patients with chronic diseases is a major and growing healthcare
challenge in several countries. A chronic condition, such as diabetes, is an
illness that lasts a long time and does not go away, and often leads to the
patient's health gradually getting worse. While recent works involve raw
electronic health record (EHR) from hospitals, this work uses only financial
records from health plan providers (medical claims) to predict diabetes disease
evolution with a self-attentive recurrent neural network. The use of financial
data is due to the possibility of being an interface to international
standards, as the records standard encodes medical procedures. The main goal
was to assess high risk diabetics, so we predict records related to diabetes
acute complications such as amputations and debridements, revascularization and
hemodialysis. Our work succeeds to anticipate complications between 60 to 240
days with an area under ROC curve ranging from 0.81 to 0.94. In this paper we
describe the first half of a work-in-progress developed within a health plan
provider with ROC curve ranging from 0.81 to 0.83. This assessment will give
healthcare providers the chance to intervene earlier and head off
hospitalizations. We are aiming to deliver personalized predictions and
personalized recommendations to individual patients, with the goal of improving
outcomes and reducing costs

    <title>DEPLOYR: A technical framework for deploying custom real-time machine
  learning models into the electronic medical record</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) applications in healthcare are extensively researched,
but successful translations to the bedside are scant. Healthcare institutions
are establishing frameworks to govern and promote the implementation of
accurate, actionable and reliable models that integrate with clinical workflow.
Such governance frameworks require an accompanying technical framework to
deploy models in a resource efficient manner. Here we present DEPLOYR, a
technical framework for enabling real-time deployment and monitoring of
researcher created clinical ML models into a widely used electronic medical
record (EMR) system. We discuss core functionality and design decisions,
including mechanisms to trigger inference based on actions within EMR software,
modules that collect real-time data to make inferences, mechanisms that
close-the-loop by displaying inferences back to end-users within their
workflow, monitoring modules that track performance of deployed models over
time, silent deployment capabilities, and mechanisms to prospectively evaluate
a deployed model's impact. We demonstrate the use of DEPLOYR by silently
deploying and prospectively evaluating twelve ML models triggered by clinician
button-clicks in Stanford Health Care's production instance of Epic. Our study
highlights the need and feasibility for such silent deployment, because
prospectively measured performance varies from retrospective estimates. By
describing DEPLOYR, we aim to inform ML deployment best practices and help
bridge the model implementation gap.

    <title>Pressure Ulcer Categorisation using Deep Learning: A Clinical Trial to
  Evaluate Model Performance</title>
    <summary>  Pressure ulcers are a challenge for patients and healthcare professionals. In
the UK, 700,000 people are affected by pressure ulcers each year. Treating them
costs the National Health Service {\pounds}3.8 million every day. Their
etiology is complex and multifactorial. However, evidence has shown a strong
link between old age, disease-related sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating
habits. Pressure ulcers are caused by direct skin contact with a bed or chair
without frequent position changes. Urinary and faecal incontinence, diabetes,
and injuries that restrict body position and nutrition are also known risk
factors. Guidelines and treatments exist but their implementation and success
vary across different healthcare settings. This is primarily because healthcare
practitioners have a) minimal experience in dealing with pressure ulcers, and
b) a general lack of understanding of pressure ulcer treatments. Poorly
managed, pressure ulcers lead to severe pain, poor quality of life, and
significant healthcare costs. In this paper, we report the findings of a
clinical trial conducted by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust that evaluated the
performance of a faster region-based convolutional neural network and mobile
platform that categorised and documented pressure ulcers. The neural network
classifies category I, II, III, and IV pressure ulcers, deep tissue injuries,
and unstageable pressure ulcers. Photographs of pressure ulcers taken by
district nurses are transmitted over 4/5G communications to an inferencing
server for classification. Classified images are stored and reviewed to assess
the model's predictions and relevance as a tool for clinical decision making
and standardised reporting. The results from the study generated a mean average
Precision=0.6796, Recall=0.6997, F1-Score=0.6786 with 45 false positives using
an @.75 confidence score threshold.

    <title>A survey on attention mechanisms for medical applications: are we moving
  towards better algorithms?</title>
    <summary>  The increasing popularity of attention mechanisms in deep learning algorithms
for computer vision and natural language processing made these models
attractive to other research domains. In healthcare, there is a strong need for
tools that may improve the routines of the clinicians and the patients.
Naturally, the use of attention-based algorithms for medical applications
occurred smoothly. However, being healthcare a domain that depends on
high-stake decisions, the scientific community must ponder if these
high-performing algorithms fit the needs of medical applications. With this
motto, this paper extensively reviews the use of attention mechanisms in
machine learning (including Transformers) for several medical applications.
This work distinguishes itself from its predecessors by proposing a critical
analysis of the claims and potentialities of attention mechanisms presented in
the literature through an experimental case study on medical image
classification with three different use cases. These experiments focus on the
integrating process of attention mechanisms into established deep learning
architectures, the analysis of their predictive power, and a visual assessment
of their saliency maps generated by post-hoc explanation methods. This paper
concludes with a critical analysis of the claims and potentialities presented
in the literature about attention mechanisms and proposes future research lines
in medical applications that may benefit from these frameworks.

    <title>Robust Fitted-Q-Evaluation and Iteration under Sequentially Exogenous
  Unobserved Confounders</title>
    <summary>  Offline reinforcement learning is important in domains such as medicine,
economics, and e-commerce where online experimentation is costly, dangerous or
unethical, and where the true model is unknown. However, most methods assume
all covariates used in the behavior policy's action decisions are observed.
Though this assumption, sequential ignorability/unconfoundedness, likely does
not hold in observational data, most of the data that accounts for selection
into treatment may be observed, motivating sensitivity analysis. We study
robust policy evaluation and policy optimization in the presence of
sequentially-exogenous unobserved confounders under a sensitivity model. We
propose and analyze orthogonalized robust fitted-Q-iteration that uses
closed-form solutions of the robust Bellman operator to derive a loss
minimization problem for the robust Q function, and adds a bias-correction to
quantile estimation. Our algorithm enjoys the computational ease of
fitted-Q-iteration and statistical improvements (reduced dependence on quantile
estimation error) from orthogonalization. We provide sample complexity bounds,
insights, and show effectiveness both in simulations and on real-world
longitudinal healthcare data of treating sepsis. In particular, our model of
sequential unobserved confounders yields an online Markov decision process,
rather than partially observed Markov decision process: we illustrate how this
can enable warm-starting optimistic reinforcement learning algorithms with
valid robust bounds from observational data.

    <title>Learning to Address Health Inequality in the United States with a
  Bayesian Decision Network</title>
    <summary>  Life-expectancy is a complex outcome driven by genetic, socio-demographic,
environmental and geographic factors. Increasing socio-economic and health
disparities in the United States are propagating the longevity-gap, making it a
cause for concern. Earlier studies have probed individual factors but an
integrated picture to reveal quantifiable actions has been missing. There is a
growing concern about a further widening of healthcare inequality caused by
Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to differential access to AI-driven services.
Hence, it is imperative to explore and exploit the potential of AI for
illuminating biases and enabling transparent policy decisions for positive
social and health impact. In this work, we reveal actionable interventions for
decreasing the longevity-gap in the United States by analyzing a County-level
data resource containing healthcare, socio-economic, behavioral, education and
demographic features. We learn an ensemble-averaged structure, draw inferences
using the joint probability distribution and extend it to a Bayesian Decision
Network for identifying policy actions. We draw quantitative estimates for the
impact of diversity, preventive-care quality and stable-families within the
unified framework of our decision network. Finally, we make this analysis and
dashboard available as an interactive web-application for enabling users and
policy-makers to validate our reported findings and to explore the impact of
ones beyond reported in this work.

    <title>Federated Reinforcement Learning with Constraint Heterogeneity</title>
    <summary>  We study a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) problem with constraint
heterogeneity. In our setting, we aim to solve a reinforcement learning problem
with multiple constraints while $N$ training agents are located in $N$
different environments with limited access to the constraint signals and they
are expected to collaboratively learn a policy satisfying all constraint
signals. Such learning problems are prevalent in scenarios of Large Language
Model (LLM) fine-tuning and healthcare applications. To solve the problem, we
propose federated primal-dual policy optimization methods based on traditional
policy gradient methods. Specifically, we introduce $N$ local Lagrange
functions for agents to perform local policy updates, and these agents are then
scheduled to periodically communicate on their local policies. Taking natural
policy gradient (NPG) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) as policy
optimization methods, we mainly focus on two instances of our algorithms, ie,
{FedNPG} and {FedPPO}. We show that FedNPG achieves global convergence with an
$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, and FedPPO efficiently solves complicated
learning tasks with the use of deep neural networks.

    <title>Clinical Tagging with Joint Probabilistic Models</title>
    <summary>  We describe a method for parameter estimation in bipartite probabilistic
graphical models for joint prediction of clinical conditions from the
electronic medical record. The method does not rely on the availability of
gold-standard labels, but rather uses noisy labels, called anchors, for
learning. We provide a likelihood-based objective and a moments-based
initialization that are effective at learning the model parameters. The learned
model is evaluated in a task of assigning a heldout clinical condition to
patients based on retrospective analysis of the records, and outperforms
baselines which do not account for the noisiness in the labels or do not model
the conditions jointly.

    <title>Deep Kernel Survival Analysis and Subject-Specific Survival Time
  Prediction Intervals</title>
    <summary>  Kernel survival analysis methods predict subject-specific survival curves and
times using information about which training subjects are most similar to a
test subject. These most similar training subjects could serve as forecast
evidence. How similar any two subjects are is given by the kernel function. In
this paper, we present the first neural network framework that learns which
kernel functions to use in kernel survival analysis. We also show how to use
kernel functions to construct prediction intervals of survival time estimates
that are statistically valid for individuals similar to a test subject. These
prediction intervals can use any kernel function, such as ones learned using
our neural kernel learning framework or using random survival forests. Our
experiments show that our neural kernel survival estimators are competitive
with a variety of existing survival analysis methods, and that our prediction
intervals can help compare different methods' uncertainties, even for
estimators that do not use kernels. In particular, these prediction interval
widths can be used as a new performance metric for survival analysis methods.

    <title>Interactive Weak Supervision: Learning Useful Heuristics for Data
  Labeling</title>
    <summary>  Obtaining large annotated datasets is critical for training successful
machine learning models and it is often a bottleneck in practice. Weak
supervision offers a promising alternative for producing labeled datasets
without ground truth annotations by generating probabilistic labels using
multiple noisy heuristics. This process can scale to large datasets and has
demonstrated state of the art performance in diverse domains such as healthcare
and e-commerce. One practical issue with learning from user-generated
heuristics is that their creation requires creativity, foresight, and domain
expertise from those who hand-craft them, a process which can be tedious and
subjective. We develop the first framework for interactive weak supervision in
which a method proposes heuristics and learns from user feedback given on each
proposed heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that only a small number of
feedback iterations are needed to train models that achieve highly competitive
test set performance without access to ground truth training labels. We conduct
user studies, which show that users are able to effectively provide feedback on
heuristics and that test set results track the performance of simulated
oracles.

    <title>A hybrid decision support system : application on healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Many systems based on knowledge, especially expert systems for medical
decision support have been developed. Only systems are based on production
rules, and cannot learn and evolve only by updating them. In addition, taking
into account several criteria induces an exorbitant number of rules to be
injected into the system. It becomes difficult to translate medical knowledge
or a support decision as a simple rule. Moreover, reasoning based on generic
cases became classic and can even reduce the range of possible solutions. To
remedy that, we propose an approach based on using a multi-criteria decision
guided by a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach.

    <title>Neural Temporal Point Processes For Modelling Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  The modelling of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has the potential to drive
more efficient allocation of healthcare resources, enabling early intervention
strategies and advancing personalised healthcare. However, EHRs are challenging
to model due to their realisation as noisy, multi-modal data occurring at
irregular time intervals. To address their temporal nature, we treat EHRs as
samples generated by a Temporal Point Process (TPP), enabling us to model what
happened in an event with when it happened in a principled way. We gather and
propose neural network parameterisations of TPPs, collectively referred to as
Neural TPPs. We perform evaluations on synthetic EHRs as well as on a set of
established benchmarks. We show that TPPs significantly outperform their
non-TPP counterparts on EHRs. We also show that an assumption of many Neural
TPPs, that the class distribution is conditionally independent of time, reduces
performance on EHRs. Finally, our proposed attention-based Neural TPP performs
favourably compared to existing models, whilst aligning with real world
interpretability requirements, an important step towards a component of
clinical decision support systems.

    <title>Efficient and Direct Inference of Heart Rate Variability using Both
  Signal Processing and Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation of the time between
consecutive heartbeats and is a major indicator of physical and mental health.
Recent research has demonstrated that photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors can be
used to infer HRV. However, many prior studies had high errors because they
only employed signal processing or machine learning (ML), or because they
indirectly inferred HRV, or because there lacks large training datasets. Many
prior studies may also require large ML models. The low accuracy and large
model sizes limit their applications to small embedded devices and potential
future use in healthcare. To address the above issues, we first collected a
large dataset of PPG signals and HRV ground truth. With this dataset, we
developed HRV models that combine signal processing and ML to directly infer
HRV. Evaluation results show that our method had errors between 3.5% to 25.7%
and outperformed signal-processing-only and ML-only methods. We also explored
different ML models, which showed that Decision Trees and Multi-level
Perceptrons have 13.0% and 9.1% errors on average with models at most hundreds
of KB and inference time less than 1ms. Hence, they are more suitable for small
embedded devices and potentially enable the future use of PPG-based HRV
monitoring in healthcare.

    <title>A machine learning framework for interpretable predictions in patient
  pathways: The case of predicting ICU admission for patients with symptoms of
  sepsis</title>
    <summary>  Proactive analysis of patient pathways helps healthcare providers anticipate
treatment-related risks, identify outcomes, and allocate resources. Machine
learning (ML) can leverage a patient's complete health history to make informed
decisions about future events. However, previous work has mostly relied on
so-called black-box models, which are unintelligible to humans, making it
difficult for clinicians to apply such models. Our work introduces PatWay-Net,
an ML framework designed for interpretable predictions of admission to the
intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with symptoms of sepsis. We propose a
novel type of recurrent neural network and combine it with multi-layer
perceptrons to process the patient pathways and produce predictive yet
interpretable results. We demonstrate its utility through a comprehensive
dashboard that visualizes patient health trajectories, predictive outcomes, and
associated risks. Our evaluation includes both predictive performance - where
PatWay-Net outperforms standard models such as decision trees, random forests,
and gradient-boosted decision trees - and clinical utility, validated through
structured interviews with clinicians. By providing improved predictive
accuracy along with interpretable and actionable insights, PatWay-Net serves as
a valuable tool for healthcare decision support in the critical case of
patients with symptoms of sepsis.

    <title>Core-set Selection Using Metrics-based Explanations (CSUME) for
  multiclass ECG</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of deep learning-based healthcare decision support systems such
as the detection of irregular cardiac rhythm is hindered by challenges such as
lack of access to quality data and the high costs associated with the
collection and annotation of data. The collection and processing of large
volumes of healthcare data is a continuous process. The performance of
data-hungry Deep Learning models (DL) is highly dependent on the quantity and
quality of the data. While the need for data quantity has been established
through research adequately, we show how a selection of good quality data
improves deep learning model performance. In this work, we take
Electrocardiogram (ECG) data as a case study and propose a model performance
improvement methodology for algorithm developers, that selects the most
informative data samples from incoming streams of multi-class ECG data. Our
Core-Set selection methodology uses metrics-based explanations to select the
most informative ECG data samples. This also provides an understanding (for
algorithm developers) as to why a sample was selected as more informative over
others for the improvement of deep learning model performance. Our experimental
results show a 9.67% and 8.69% precision and recall improvement with a
significant training data volume reduction of 50%. Additionally, our proposed
methodology asserts the quality and annotation of ECG samples from incoming
data streams. It allows automatic detection of individual data samples that do
not contribute to model learning thus minimizing possible negative effects on
model performance. We further discuss the potential generalizability of our
approach by experimenting with a different dataset and deep learning
architecture.

    <title>Simultaneous Modeling of Multiple Complications for Risk Profiling in
  Diabetes Care</title>
    <summary>  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that often results in
multiple complications. Risk prediction and profiling of T2DM complications is
critical for healthcare professionals to design personalized treatment plans
for patients in diabetes care for improved outcomes. In this paper, we study
the risk of developing complications after the initial T2DM diagnosis from
longitudinal patient records. We propose a novel multi-task learning approach
to simultaneously model multiple complications where each task corresponds to
the risk modeling of one complication. Specifically, the proposed method
strategically captures the relationships (1) between the risks of multiple T2DM
complications, (2) between the different risk factors, and (3) between the risk
factor selection patterns. The method uses coefficient shrinkage to identify an
informative subset of risk factors from high-dimensional data, and uses a
hierarchical Bayesian framework to allow domain knowledge to be incorporated as
priors. The proposed method is favorable for healthcare applications because in
additional to improved prediction performance, relationships among the
different risks and risk factors are also identified. Extensive experimental
results on a large electronic medical claims database show that the proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.
Furthermore, we show that the risk associations learned and the risk factors
identified lead to meaningful clinical insights.

    <title>HOLMES: Health OnLine Model Ensemble Serving for Deep Learning Models in
  Intensive Care Units</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have achieved expert-level performance in healthcare
with an exclusive focus on training accurate models. However, in many clinical
environments such as intensive care unit (ICU), real-time model serving is
equally if not more important than accuracy, because in ICU patient care is
simultaneously more urgent and more expensive. Clinical decisions and their
timeliness, therefore, directly affect both the patient outcome and the cost of
care. To make timely decisions, we argue the underlying serving system must be
latency-aware. To compound the challenge, health analytic applications often
require a combination of models instead of a single model, to better specialize
individual models for different targets, multi-modal data, different prediction
windows, and potentially personalized predictions. To address these challenges,
we propose HOLMES-an online model ensemble serving framework for healthcare
applications. HOLMES dynamically identifies the best performing set of models
to ensemble for highest accuracy, while also satisfying sub-second latency
constraints on end-to-end prediction. We demonstrate that HOLMES is able to
navigate the accuracy/latency tradeoff efficiently, compose the ensemble, and
serve the model ensemble pipeline, scaling to simultaneously streaming data
from 100 patients, each producing waveform data at 250~Hz. HOLMES outperforms
the conventional offline batch-processed inference for the same clinical task
in terms of accuracy and latency (by order of magnitude). HOLMES is tested on
risk prediction task on pediatric cardio ICU data with above 95% prediction
accuracy and sub-second latency on 64-bed simulation.

    <title>Machine Learning Approaches for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction and Care
  Management</title>
    <summary>  Prediction of diabetes and its various complications has been studied in a
number of settings, but a comprehensive overview of problem setting for
diabetes prediction and care management has not been addressed in the
literature. In this document we seek to remedy this omission in literature with
an encompassing overview of diabetes complication prediction as well as
situating this problem in the context of real world healthcare management. We
illustrate various problems encountered in real world clinical scenarios via
our own experience with building and deploying such models. In this manuscript
we illustrate a Machine Learning (ML) framework for addressing the problem of
predicting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) together with a solution for risk
stratification, intervention and management. These ML models align with how
physicians think about disease management and mitigation, which comprises these
four steps: Identify, Stratify, Engage, Measure.

    <title>New Epochs in AI Supervision: Design and Implementation of an Autonomous
  Radiology AI Monitoring System</title>
    <summary>  With the increasingly widespread adoption of AI in healthcare, maintaining
the accuracy and reliability of AI models in clinical practice has become
crucial. In this context, we introduce novel methods for monitoring the
performance of radiology AI classification models in practice, addressing the
challenges of obtaining real-time ground truth for performance monitoring. We
propose two metrics - predictive divergence and temporal stability - to be used
for preemptive alerts of AI performance changes. Predictive divergence,
measured using Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences, evaluates model
accuracy by comparing predictions with those of two supplementary models.
Temporal stability is assessed through a comparison of current predictions
against historical moving averages, identifying potential model decay or data
drift. This approach was retrospectively validated using chest X-ray data from
a single-center imaging clinic, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining
AI model reliability. By providing continuous, real-time insights into model
performance, our system ensures the safe and effective use of AI in clinical
decision-making, paving the way for more robust AI integration in healthcare

    <title>LLM-Based Section Identifiers Excel on Open Source but Stumble in Real
  World Applications</title>
    <summary>  Electronic health records (EHR) even though a boon for healthcare
practitioners, are growing convoluted and longer every day. Sifting around
these lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient
interaction. Several approaches have been proposed to help alleviate this
prevalent issue either via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few
approaches have truly been helpful in the past. With the rise of automated
methods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of
identifying relevant sections in EHR. However, most ML methods rely on labeled
data which is difficult to get in healthcare. Large language models (LLMs) on
the other hand, have performed impressive feats in natural language processing
(NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. To that
end, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that
GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well
as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we
also annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to
perform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.

    <title>gLOP: the global and Local Penalty for Capturing Predictive
  Heterogeneity</title>
    <summary>  When faced with a supervised learning problem, we hope to have rich enough
data to build a model that predicts future instances well. However, in
practice, problems can exhibit predictive heterogeneity: most instances might
be relatively easy to predict, while others might be predictive outliers for
which a model trained on the entire dataset does not perform well. Identifying
these can help focus future data collection. We present gLOP, the global and
Local Penalty, a framework for capturing predictive heterogeneity and
identifying predictive outliers. gLOP is based on penalized regression for
multitask learning, which improves learning by leveraging training signal
information from related tasks. We give two optimization algorithms for gLOP,
one space-efficient, and another giving the full regularization path. We also
characterize uniqueness in terms of the data and tuning parameters, and present
empirical results on synthetic data and on two health research problems.

    <title>Learning Counterfactual Representations for Estimating Individual
  Dose-Response Curves</title>
    <summary>  Estimating what would be an individual's potential response to varying levels
of exposure to a treatment is of high practical relevance for several important
fields, such as healthcare, economics and public policy. However, existing
methods for learning to estimate counterfactual outcomes from observational
data are either focused on estimating average dose-response curves, or limited
to settings with only two treatments that do not have an associated dosage
parameter. Here, we present a novel machine-learning approach towards learning
counterfactual representations for estimating individual dose-response curves
for any number of treatments with continuous dosage parameters with neural
networks. Building on the established potential outcomes framework, we
introduce performance metrics, model selection criteria, model architectures,
and open benchmarks for estimating individual dose-response curves. Our
experiments show that the methods developed in this work set a new
state-of-the-art in estimating individual dose-response.

    <title>AutoPrognosis: Automated Clinical Prognostic Modeling via Bayesian
  Optimization with Structured Kernel Learning</title>
    <summary>  Clinical prognostic models derived from largescale healthcare data can inform
critical diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelf usage of
machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a
system for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for
clinical prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline
configurations efficiently using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO)
algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines
high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure.
This is achieved by modeling the pipelines performances as a black-box function
with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the similarities between the
pipelines baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet
prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from similar
patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the
empirical Bayes method. The system automatically explains its predictions by
presenting the clinicians with logical association rules that link patients
features to predicted risk strata. We demonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS
using 10 major patient cohorts representing various aspects of cardiovascular
patient care.

    <title>Learning from Irregularly-Sampled Time Series: A Missing Data
  Perspective</title>
    <summary>  Irregularly-sampled time series occur in many domains including healthcare.
They can be challenging to model because they do not naturally yield a
fixed-dimensional representation as required by many standard machine learning
models. In this paper, we consider irregular sampling from the perspective of
missing data. We model observed irregularly-sampled time series data as a
sequence of index-value pairs sampled from a continuous but unobserved
function. We introduce an encoder-decoder framework for learning from such
generic indexed sequences. We propose learning methods for this framework based
on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. For continuous
irregularly-sampled time series, we introduce continuous convolutional layers
that can efficiently interface with existing neural network architectures.
Experiments show that our models are able to achieve competitive or better
classification results on irregularly-sampled multivariate time series compared
to recent RNN models while offering significantly faster training times.

    <title>Double Robust Representation Learning for Counterfactual Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Causal inference, or counterfactual prediction, is central to decision making
in healthcare, policy and social sciences. To de-bias causal estimators with
high-dimensional data in observational studies, recent advances suggest the
importance of combining machine learning models for both the propensity score
and the outcome function. We propose a novel scalable method to learn
double-robust representations for counterfactual predictions, leading to
consistent causal estimation if the model for either the propensity score or
the outcome, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Specifically, we
use the entropy balancing method to learn the weights that minimize the
Jensen-Shannon divergence of the representation between the treated and control
groups, based on which we make robust and efficient counterfactual predictions
for both individual and average treatment effects. We provide theoretical
justifications for the proposed method. The algorithm shows competitive
performance with the state-of-the-art on real world and synthetic data.

    <title>Split Learning for Distributed Collaborative Training of Deep Learning
  Models in Health Informatics</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning continues to rapidly evolve and is now demonstrating remarkable
potential for numerous medical prediction tasks. However, realizing deep
learning models that generalize across healthcare organizations is challenging.
This is due, in part, to the inherent siloed nature of these organizations and
patient privacy requirements. To address this problem, we illustrate how split
learning can enable collaborative training of deep learning models across
disparate and privately maintained health datasets, while keeping the original
records and model parameters private. We introduce a new privacy-preserving
distributed learning framework that offers a higher level of privacy compared
to conventional federated learning. We use several biomedical imaging and
electronic health record (EHR) datasets to show that deep learning models
trained via split learning can achieve highly similar performance to their
centralized and federated counterparts while greatly improving computational
efficiency and reducing privacy risks.

    <title>Video-Based Inpatient Fall Risk Assessment: A Case Study</title>
    <summary>  Inpatient falls are a serious safety issue in hospitals and healthcare
facilities. Recent advances in video analytics for patient monitoring provide a
non-intrusive avenue to reduce this risk through continuous activity
monitoring. However, in-bed fall risk assessment systems have received less
attention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have focused on fall
event detection, and do not consider the circumstances that may indicate an
imminent inpatient fall. Here, we propose a video-based system that can monitor
the risk of a patient falling, and alert staff of unsafe behaviour to help
prevent falls before they occur. We propose an approach that leverages recent
advances in human localisation and skeleton pose estimation to extract spatial
features from video frames recorded in a simulated environment. We demonstrate
that body positions can be effectively recognised and provide useful evidence
for fall risk assessment. This work highlights the benefits of video-based
models for analysing behaviours of interest, and demonstrates how such a system
could enable sufficient lead time for healthcare professionals to respond and
address patient needs, which is necessary for the development of fall
intervention programs.

    <title>Unveiling Latent Causal Rules: A Temporal Point Process Approach for
  Abnormal Event Explanation</title>
    <summary>  In high-stakes systems such as healthcare, it is critical to understand the
causal reasons behind unusual events, such as sudden changes in patient's
health. Unveiling the causal reasons helps with quick diagnoses and precise
treatment planning. In this paper, we propose an automated method for
uncovering "if-then" logic rules to explain observational events. We introduce
temporal point processes to model the events of interest, and discover the set
of latent rules to explain the occurrence of events. To achieve this, we employ
an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, we calculate the
likelihood of each event being explained by each discovered rule. In the
M-step, we update both the rule set and model parameters to enhance the
likelihood function's lower bound. Notably, we optimize the rule set in a
differential manner. Our approach demonstrates accurate performance in both
discovering rules and identifying root causes. We showcase its promising
results using synthetic and real healthcare datasets.

    <title>Large scale modeling of antimicrobial resistance with interpretable
  classifiers</title>
    <summary>  Antimicrobial resistance is an important public health concern that has
implications in the practice of medicine worldwide. Accurately predicting
resistance phenotypes from genome sequences shows great promise in promoting
better use of antimicrobial agents, by determining which antibiotics are likely
to be effective in specific clinical cases. In healthcare, this would allow for
the design of treatment plans tailored for specific individuals, likely
resulting in better clinical outcomes for patients with bacterial infections.
In this work, we present the recent work of Drouin et al. (2016) on using Set
Covering Machines to learn highly interpretable models of antibiotic resistance
and complement it by providing a large scale application of their method to the
entire PATRIC database. We report prediction results for 36 new datasets and
present the Kover AMR platform, a new web-based tool allowing the visualization
and interpretation of the generated models.

    <title>MCA-based Rule Mining Enables Interpretable Inference in Clinical
  Psychiatry</title>
    <summary>  Development of interpretable machine learning models for clinical healthcare
applications has the potential of changing the way we understand, treat, and
ultimately cure, diseases and disorders in many areas of medicine. These models
can serve not only as sources of predictions and estimates, but also as
discovery tools for clinicians and researchers to reveal new knowledge from the
data. High dimensionality of patient information (e.g., phenotype, genotype,
and medical history), lack of objective measurements, and the heterogeneity in
patient populations often create significant challenges in developing
interpretable machine learning models for clinical psychiatry in practice. In
this paper we take a step towards the development of such interpretable models.
First, by developing a novel categorical rule mining method based on
Multivariate Correspondence Analysis (MCA) capable of handling datasets with
large numbers of features, and second, by applying this method to build
transdiagnostic Bayesian Rule List models to screen for psychiatric disorders
using the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics dataset. We show that our
method is not only at least 100 times faster than state-of-the-art rule mining
techniques for datasets with 50 features, but also provides interpretability
and comparable prediction accuracy across several benchmark datasets.

    <title>Harmonic Mean Point Processes: Proportional Rate Error Minimization for
  Obtundation Prediction</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare, the highest risk individuals for morbidity and mortality are
rarely those with the greatest modifiable risk. By contrast, many machine
learning formulations implicitly attend to the highest risk individuals. We
focus on this problem in point processes, a popular modeling technique for the
analysis of the temporal event sequences in electronic health records (EHR)
data with applications in risk stratification and risk score systems. We show
that optimization of the log-likelihood function also gives disproportionate
attention to high risk individuals and leads to poor prediction results for low
risk individuals compared to ones at high risk. We characterize the problem and
propose an adjusted log-likelihood formulation as a new objective for point
processes. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in simulations and in EHR
data of patients admitted to the critical care unit for intracerebral
hemorrhage.

    <title>Guidance on the Assurance of Machine Learning in Autonomous Systems
  (AMLAS)</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) is now used in a range of systems with results that are
reported to exceed, under certain conditions, human performance. Many of these
systems, in domains such as healthcare , automotive and manufacturing, exhibit
high degrees of autonomy and are safety critical. Establishing justified
confidence in ML forms a core part of the safety case for these systems. In
this document we introduce a methodology for the Assurance of Machine Learning
for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS). AMLAS comprises a set of safety case
patterns and a process for (1) systematically integrating safety assurance into
the development of ML components and (2) for generating the evidence base for
explicitly justifying the acceptable safety of these components when integrated
into autonomous system applications.

    <title>Trusting Machine Learning Results from Medical Procedures in the
  Operating Room</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning can be used to analyse physiological data for several
purposes. Detection of cerebral ischemia is an achievement that would have high
impact on patient care. We attempted to study if collection of continous
physiological data from non-invasive monitors, and analysis with machine
learning could detect cerebral ischemia in tho different setting, during
surgery for carotid endarterectomy and during endovascular thrombectomy in
acute stroke. We compare the results from the two different group and one
patient from each group in details. While results from CEA-patients are
consistent, those from thrombectomy patients are not and frequently contain
extreme values such as 1.0 in accuracy. We conlcude that this is a result of
short duration of the procedure and abundance of data with bad quality
resulting in small data sets. These results can therefore not be trusted.

    <title>Imputation Strategies Under Clinical Presence: Impact on Algorithmic
  Fairness</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning risks reinforcing biases present in data, and, as we argue
in this work, in what is absent from data. In healthcare, biases have marked
medical history, leading to unequal care affecting marginalised groups.
Patterns in missing data often reflect these group discrepancies, but the
algorithmic fairness implications of group-specific missingness are not well
understood. Despite its potential impact, imputation is often an overlooked
preprocessing step, with attention placed on the reduction of reconstruction
error and overall performance, ignoring how imputation can affect groups
differently. Our work studies how imputation choices affect reconstruction
errors across groups and algorithmic fairness properties of downstream
predictions.

    <title>MIMIC-Extract: A Data Extraction, Preprocessing, and Representation
  Pipeline for MIMIC-III</title>
    <summary>  Robust machine learning relies on access to data that can be used with
standardized frameworks in important tasks and the ability to develop models
whose performance can be reasonably reproduced. In machine learning for
healthcare, the community faces reproducibility challenges due to a lack of
publicly accessible data and a lack of standardized data processing frameworks.
We present MIMIC-Extract, an open-source pipeline for transforming raw
electronic health record (EHR) data for critical care patients contained in the
publicly-available MIMIC-III database into dataframes that are directly usable
in common machine learning pipelines. MIMIC-Extract addresses three primary
challenges in making complex health records data accessible to the broader
machine learning community. First, it provides standardized data processing
functions, including unit conversion, outlier detection, and aggregating
semantically equivalent features, thus accounting for duplication and reducing
missingness. Second, it preserves the time series nature of clinical data and
can be easily integrated into clinically actionable prediction tasks in machine
learning for health. Finally, it is highly extensible so that other researchers
with related questions can easily use the same pipeline. We demonstrate the
utility of this pipeline by showcasing several benchmark tasks and baseline
results.

    <title>An Efficient Imbalance-Aware Federated Learning Approach for Wearable
  Healthcare with Autoregressive Ratio Observation</title>
    <summary>  Widely available healthcare services are now getting popular because of
advancements in wearable sensing techniques and mobile edge computing. People's
health information is collected by edge devices such as smartphones and
wearable bands for further analysis on servers, then send back suggestions and
alerts for abnormal conditions. The recent emergence of federated learning
allows users to train private data on local devices while updating models
collaboratively. However, the heterogeneous distribution of the health
condition data may lead to significant risks to model performance due to class
imbalance. Meanwhile, as FL training is powered by sharing gradients only with
the server, training data is almost inaccessible. The conventional solutions to
class imbalance do not work for federated learning. In this work, we propose a
new federated learning framework FedImT, dedicated to addressing the challenges
of class imbalance in federated learning scenarios. FedImT contains an online
scheme that can estimate the data composition during each round of aggregation,
then introduces a self-attenuating iterative equivalent to track variations of
multiple estimations and promptly tweak the balance of the loss computing for
minority classes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedImT in
solving the imbalance problem without extra energy consumption and avoiding
privacy risks.

    <title>Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Symptom Recognition from Spanish
  Clinical Text</title>
    <summary>  The accurate recognition of symptoms in clinical reports is significantly
important in the fields of healthcare and biomedical natural language
processing. These entities serve as essential building blocks for clinical
information extraction, enabling retrieval of critical medical insights from
vast amounts of textual data. Furthermore, the ability to identify and
categorize these entities is fundamental for developing advanced clinical
decision support systems, aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosis and
treatment planning. In this study, we participated in SympTEMIST, a shared task
on the detection of symptoms, signs and findings in Spanish medical documents.
We combine a set of large language models fine-tuned with the data released by
the organizers.

    <title>HealthGAT: Node Classifications in Electronic Health Records using Graph
  Attention Networks</title>
    <summary>  While electronic health records (EHRs) are widely used across various
applications in healthcare, most applications use the EHRs in their raw
(tabular) format. Relying on raw or simple data pre-processing can greatly
limit the performance or even applicability of downstream tasks using EHRs. To
address this challenge, we present HealthGAT, a novel graph attention network
framework that utilizes a hierarchical approach to generate embeddings from
EHR, surpassing traditional graph-based methods. Our model iteratively refines
the embeddings for medical codes, resulting in improved EHR data analysis. We
also introduce customized EHR-centric auxiliary pre-training tasks to leverage
the rich medical knowledge embedded within the data. This approach provides a
comprehensive analysis of complex medical relationships and offers significant
advancement over standard data representation techniques. HealthGAT has
demonstrated its effectiveness in various healthcare scenarios through
comprehensive evaluations against established methodologies. Specifically, our
model shows outstanding performance in node classification and downstream tasks
such as predicting readmissions and diagnosis classifications.

    <title>Ontology for Healthcare Artificial Intelligence Privacy in Brazil</title>
    <summary>  This article details the creation of a novel domain ontology at the
intersection of epidemiology, medicine, statistics, and computer science. Using
the terminology defined by current legislation, the article outlines a
systematic approach to handling hospital data anonymously in preparation for
its use in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. The
development process consisted of 7 pragmatic steps, including defining scope,
selecting knowledge, reviewing important terms, constructing classes that
describe designs used in epidemiological studies, machine learning paradigms,
types of data and attributes, risks that anonymized data may be exposed to,
privacy attacks, techniques to mitigate re-identification, privacy models, and
metrics for measuring the effects of anonymization. The article concludes by
demonstrating the practical implementation of this ontology in hospital
settings for the development and validation of AI.

    <title>Herb-Drug Interactions: A Holistic Decision Support System in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Complementary and alternative medicine are commonly used concomitantly with
conventional medications leading to adverse drug reactions and even fatality in
some cases. Furthermore, the vast possibility of herb-drug interactions
prevents health professionals from remembering or manually searching them in a
database. Decision support systems are a powerful tool that can be used to
assist clinicians in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in patient
care. Therefore, an original and hybrid decision support system was designed to
identify herb-drug interactions, applying artificial intelligence techniques to
identify new possible interactions. Different machine learning models will be
used to strengthen the typical rules engine used in these cases. Thus, using
the proposed system, the pharmacy community, people's first line of contact
within the Healthcare System, will be able to make better and more accurate
therapeutic decisions and mitigate possible adverse events.

    <title>Deployment of a Robust and Explainable Mortality Prediction Model: The
  COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond</title>
    <summary>  This study investigated the performance, explainability, and robustness of
deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models in predicting mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The first study of its kind, we found that
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and intelligent training techniques allowed our
models to maintain performance amidst significant data shifts. Our results
emphasize the importance of developing robust AI models capable of matching or
surpassing clinician predictions, even under challenging conditions. Our
exploration of model explainability revealed that stochastic models generate
more diverse and personalized explanations thereby highlighting the need for AI
models that provide detailed and individualized insights in real-world clinical
settings. Furthermore, we underscored the importance of quantifying uncertainty
in AI models which enables clinicians to make better-informed decisions based
on reliable predictions. Our study advocates for prioritizing implementation
science in AI research for healthcare and ensuring that AI solutions are
practical, beneficial, and sustainable in real-world clinical environments. By
addressing unique challenges and complexities in healthcare settings,
researchers can develop AI models that effectively improve clinical practice
and patient outcomes.

    <title>MedLM: Exploring Language Models for Medical Question Answering Systems</title>
    <summary>  In the face of rapidly expanding online medical literature, automated systems
for aggregating and summarizing information are becoming increasingly crucial
for healthcare professionals and patients. Large Language Models (LLMs), with
their advanced generative capabilities, have shown promise in various NLP
tasks, and their potential in the healthcare domain, particularly for
Closed-Book Generative QnA, is significant. However, the performance of these
models in domain-specific tasks such as medical Q&amp;A remains largely unexplored.
This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the performance of general and
medical-specific distilled LMs for medical Q&amp;A. We aim to evaluate the
effectiveness of fine-tuning domain-specific LMs and compare the performance of
different families of Language Models. The study will address critical
questions about these models' reliability, comparative performance, and
effectiveness in the context of medical Q&amp;A. The findings will provide valuable
insights into the suitability of different LMs for specific applications in the
medical domain.

    <title>Data Distribution Dynamics in Real-World WiFi-Based Patient Activity
  Monitoring for Home Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  This paper examines the application of WiFi signals for real-world monitoring
of daily activities in home healthcare scenarios. While the state-of-the-art of
WiFi-based activity recognition is promising in lab environments, challenges
arise in real-world settings due to environmental, subject, and system
configuration variables, affecting accuracy and adaptability. The research
involved deploying systems in various settings and analyzing data shifts. It
aims to guide realistic development of robust, context-aware WiFi sensing
systems for elderly care. The findings suggest a shift in WiFi-based activity
sensing, bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications,
enhancing life quality through technology.

    <title>What Clinicians Want: Contextualizing Explainable Machine Learning for
  Clinical End Use</title>
    <summary>  Translating machine learning (ML) models effectively to clinical practice
requires establishing clinicians' trust. Explainability, or the ability of an
ML model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the
model prediction, has been generally understood to be critical to establishing
trust. However, the field suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for
usable explanations in different settings. To identify specific aspects of
explainability that may catalyze building trust in ML models, we surveyed
clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties (Intenstive Care Unit and
Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize when
explainability helps to improve clinicians' trust in ML models. We further
identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most
relevant and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally,
we discern concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability
methods. By integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML
researchers we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and
sustained use of ML systems in healthcare.

    <title>An Empirical Comparison of Bias Reduction Methods on Real-World Problems
  in High-Stakes Policy Settings</title>
    <summary>  Applications of machine learning (ML) to high-stakes policy settings -- such
as education, criminal justice, healthcare, and social service delivery -- have
grown rapidly in recent years, sparking important conversations about how to
ensure fair outcomes from these systems. The machine learning research
community has responded to this challenge with a wide array of proposed
fairness-enhancing strategies for ML models, but despite the large number of
methods that have been developed, little empirical work exists evaluating these
methods in real-world settings. Here, we seek to fill this research gap by
investigating the performance of several methods that operate at different
points in the ML pipeline across four real-world public policy and social good
problems. Across these problems, we find a wide degree of variability and
inconsistency in the ability of many of these methods to improve model
fairness, but post-processing by choosing group-specific score thresholds
consistently removes disparities, with important implications for both the ML
research community and practitioners deploying machine learning to inform
consequential policy decisions.

    <title>auton-survival: an Open-Source Package for Regression, Counterfactual
  Estimation, Evaluation and Phenotyping with Censored Time-to-Event Data</title>
    <summary>  Applications of machine learning in healthcare often require working with
time-to-event prediction tasks including prognostication of an adverse event,
re-hospitalization or death. Such outcomes are typically subject to censoring
due to loss of follow up. Standard machine learning methods cannot be applied
in a straightforward manner to datasets with censored outcomes. In this paper,
we present auton-survival, an open-source repository of tools to streamline
working with censored time-to-event or survival data. auton-survival includes
tools for survival regression, adjustment in the presence of domain shift,
counterfactual estimation, phenotyping for risk stratification, evaluation, as
well as estimation of treatment effects. Through real world case studies
employing a large subset of the SEER oncology incidence data, we demonstrate
the ability of auton-survival to rapidly support data scientists in answering
complex health and epidemiological questions.

    <title>Provable Membership Inference Privacy</title>
    <summary>  In applications involving sensitive data, such as finance and healthcare, the
necessity for preserving data privacy can be a significant barrier to machine
learning model development. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as one
canonical standard for provable privacy. However, DP's strong theoretical
guarantees often come at the cost of a large drop in its utility for machine
learning, and DP guarantees themselves can be difficult to interpret. In this
work, we propose a novel privacy notion, membership inference privacy (MIP), to
address these challenges. We give a precise characterization of the
relationship between MIP and DP, and show that MIP can be achieved using less
amount of randomness compared to the amount required for guaranteeing DP,
leading to a smaller drop in utility. MIP guarantees are also easily
interpretable in terms of the success rate of membership inference attacks. Our
theoretical results also give rise to a simple algorithm for guaranteeing MIP
which can be used as a wrapper around any algorithm with a continuous output,
including parametric model training.

    <title>Applications of machine learning and IoT for Outdoor Air Pollution
  Monitoring and Prediction: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
    <summary>  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills seven
million people every year. Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental
health problem affecting low, middle, and high-income countries. In the past
few years, the research community has explored IoT-enabled machine learning
applications for outdoor air pollution prediction. The general objective of
this paper is to systematically review applications of machine learning and
Internet of Things (IoT) for outdoor air pollution prediction and the
combination of monitoring sensors and input features used. Two research
questions were formulated for this review. 1086 publications were collected in
the initial PRISMA stage. After the screening and eligibility phases, 37 papers
were selected for inclusion. A cost-based analysis was conducted on the
findings to highlight high-cost monitoring, low-cost IoT and hybrid enabled
prediction. Three methods of prediction were identified: time series,
feature-based and spatio-temporal. This review's findings identify major
limitations in applications found in the literature, namely lack of coverage,
lack of diversity of data and lack of inclusion of context-specific features.
This review proposes directions for future research and underlines practical
implications in healthcare, urban planning, global synergy and smart cities.

    <title>Updating Clinical Risk Stratification Models Using Rank-Based
  Compatibility: Approaches for Evaluating and Optimizing Clinician-Model Team
  Performance</title>
    <summary>  As data shift or new data become available, updating clinical machine
learning models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time.
However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior
of the updated model does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor
user-model team performance. Existing compatibility measures depend on model
decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:
$0.005$, $0.035$). This work provides new tools to analyze and update risk
stratification models used in clinical care.

    <title>An Intelligent Non-Invasive Real Time Human Activity Recognition System
  for Next-Generation Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Human motion detection is getting considerable attention in the field of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven healthcare systems. Human motion can be
used to provide remote healthcare solutions for vulnerable people by
identifying particular movements such as falls, gait and breathing disorders.
This can allow people to live more independent lifestyles and still have the
safety of being monitored if more direct care is needed. At present wearable
devices can provide real time monitoring by deploying equipment on a person's
body. However, putting devices on a person's body all the time make it
uncomfortable and the elderly tends to forget it to wear as well in addition to
the insecurity of being tracked all the time. This paper demonstrates how human
motions can be detected in quasi-real-time scenario using a non-invasive
method. Patterns in the wireless signals presents particular human body motions
as each movement induces a unique change in the wireless medium. These changes
can be used to identify particular body motions. This work produces a dataset
that contains patterns of radio wave signals obtained using software defined
radios (SDRs) to establish if a subject is standing up or sitting down as a
test case. The dataset was used to create a machine learning model, which was
used in a developed application to provide a quasi-real-time classification of
standing or sitting state. The machine learning model was able to achieve 96.70
% accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm using 10 fold cross validation. A
benchmark dataset of wearable devices was compared to the proposed dataset and
results showed the proposed dataset to have similar accuracy of nearly 90 %.
The machine learning models developed in this paper are tested for two
activities but the developed system is designed and applicable for detecting
and differentiating x number of activities.

    <title>TRACER: A Framework for Facilitating Accurate and Interpretable
  Analytics for High Stakes Applications</title>
    <summary>  In high stakes applications such as healthcare and finance analytics, the
interpretability of predictive models is required and necessary for domain
practitioners to trust the predictions. Traditional machine learning models,
e.g., logistic regression (LR), are easy to interpret in nature. However, many
of these models aggregate time-series data without considering the temporal
correlations and variations. Therefore, their performance cannot match up to
recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, which are nonetheless difficult to
interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework TRACER to facilitate
accurate and interpretable predictions, with a novel model TITV devised for
healthcare analytics and other high stakes applications such as financial
investment and risk management. Different from LR and other existing RNN-based
models, TITV is designed to capture both the time-invariant and the
time-variant feature importance using a feature-wise transformation subnetwork
and a self-attention subnetwork, for the feature influence shared over the
entire time series and the time-related importance respectively. Healthcare
analytics is adopted as a driving use case, and we note that the proposed
TRACER is also applicable to other domains, e.g., fintech. We evaluate the
accuracy of TRACER extensively in two real-world hospital datasets, and our
doctors/clinicians further validate the interpretability of TRACER in both the
patient level and the feature level. Besides, TRACER is also validated in a
high stakes financial application and a critical temperature forecasting
application. The experimental results confirm that TRACER facilitates both
accurate and interpretable analytics for high stakes applications.

    <title>Histopathological Image Classification and Vulnerability Analysis using
  Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare is one of the foremost applications of machine learning (ML).
Traditionally, ML models are trained by central servers, which aggregate data
from various distributed devices to forecast the results for newly generated
data. This is a major concern as models can access sensitive user information,
which raises privacy concerns. A federated learning (FL) approach can help
address this issue: A global model sends its copy to all clients who train
these copies, and the clients send the updates (weights) back to it. Over time,
the global model improves and becomes more accurate. Data privacy is protected
during training, as it is conducted locally on the clients' devices.
  However, the global model is susceptible to data poisoning. We develop a
privacy-preserving FL technique for a skin cancer dataset and show that the
model is prone to data poisoning attacks. Ten clients train the model, but one
of them intentionally introduces flipped labels as an attack. This reduces the
accuracy of the global model. As the percentage of label flipping increases,
there is a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We use a stochastic gradient
descent optimization algorithm to find the most optimal accuracy for the model.
Although FL can protect user privacy for healthcare diagnostics, it is also
vulnerable to data poisoning, which must be addressed.

    <title>Novel EEG based Schizophrenia Detection with IoMT Framework for Smart
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In the field of neuroscience, Brain activity analysis is always considered as
an important area. Schizophrenia(Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects
the thinking, behaviour, and feelings of people all around the world.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz
detection. EEG is a non-linear time-seriesi signal and utilizing it for
investigation is rather crucial due to its non-linear structure. This paper
aims to improve the performance of EEG based Sz detection using a deep learning
approach. A novel hybrid deep learning model known as SzHNN (Schizophrenia
Hybrid Neural Network), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed. CNN network is used for
local feature extraction and LSTM has been utilized for classification. The
proposed model has been compared with CNN only, LSTM only, and machine
learning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different
datasets wherein Dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and Dataset 2 consists of 16
subjects. Several experiments have been conducted for the same using various
parametric settings on different frequency bands and using different sets of
electrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the
proposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of
99.9% in comparison to other existing models. The proposed model overcomes the
influence of different frequency bands and even showed a much better accuracy
of 91% with only 5 electrodes. The proposed model is also evaluated on the
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare and remote
monitoring applications.

    <title>Transfer Learning to Detect COVID-19 Coughs with Incremental Addition of
  Patient Coughs to Healthy People's Cough Detection Models</title>
    <summary>  Millions of people have died worldwide from COVID-19. In addition to its high
death toll, COVID-19 has led to unbearable suffering for individuals and a huge
global burden to the healthcare sector. Therefore, researchers have been trying
to develop tools to detect symptoms of this human-transmissible disease
remotely to control its rapid spread. Coughing is one of the common symptoms
that researchers have been trying to detect objectively from smartphone
microphone-sensing. While most of the approaches to detect and track cough
symptoms rely on machine learning models developed from a large amount of
patient data, this is not possible at the early stage of an outbreak. In this
work, we present an incremental transfer learning approach that leverages the
relationship between healthy peoples' coughs and COVID-19 patients' coughs to
detect COVID-19 coughs with reasonable accuracy using a pre-trained healthy
cough detection model and a relatively small set of patient coughs, reducing
the need for large patient dataset to train the model. This type of model can
be a game changer in detecting the onset of a novel respiratory virus.

    <title>Pre-training transformer-based framework on large-scale pediatric claims
  data for downstream population-specific tasks</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during
the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning
from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been
built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto
diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population
that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is
scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This
study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic
pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,
followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The
semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,
and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware
fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter
modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data
scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small
patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with
more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream
tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic
pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving
more than 10\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In
addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer
learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future
healthcare model pre-training across institutions.

    <title>Multi-task Learning via Adaptation to Similar Tasks for Mortality
  Prediction of Diverse Rare Diseases</title>
    <summary>  Mortality prediction of diverse rare diseases using electronic health record
(EHR) data is a crucial task for intelligent healthcare. However, data
insufficiency and the clinical diversity of rare diseases make it hard for
directly training deep learning models on individual disease data or all the
data from different diseases. Mortality prediction for these patients with
different diseases can be viewed as a multi-task learning problem with
insufficient data and large task number. But the tasks with little training
data also make it hard to train task-specific modules in multi-task learning
models. To address the challenges of data insufficiency and task diversity, we
propose an initialization-sharing multi-task learning method (Ada-Sit) which
learns the parameter initialization for fast adaptation to dynamically measured
similar tasks. We use Ada-Sit to train long short-term memory networks (LSTM)
based prediction models on longitudinal EHR data. And experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for mortality prediction of
diverse rare diseases.

    <title>Multi-Label Learning from Medical Plain Text with Convolutional Residual
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Predicting diagnoses from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is an important
medical application of multi-label learning. We propose a convolutional
residual model for multi-label classification from doctor notes in EHR data. A
given patient may have multiple diagnoses, and therefore multi-label learning
is required. We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to encode plain
text into a fixed-length sentence embedding vector. Since diagnoses are
typically correlated, a deep residual network is employed on top of the CNN
encoder, to capture label (diagnosis) dependencies and incorporate information
directly from the encoded sentence vector. A real EHR dataset is considered,
and we compare the proposed model with several well-known baselines, to predict
diagnoses based on doctor notes. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed convolutional residual model.

    <title>Customer 360-degree Insights in Predicting Chronic Diabetes</title>
    <summary>  Chronic diseases such as diabetes are quite prevalent in the world and are
responsible for a significant number of deaths per year. In addition,
treatments for such chronic diseases account for a high healthcare cost.
However, research has shown that diabetes can be proactively managed and
prevented while lowering these healthcare costs. We have mined a sample of ten
million customers' 360-degree data representing the state of Texas, USA, with
attributes current as of late 2018. The sample received from a market research
data vendor has over 1000 customer attributes consisting of demography,
lifestyle, and in some cases self-reported chronic conditions. In this study,
we have developed a classification model to predict chronic diabetes with an
accuracy of 80%. We demonstrate a use case where a large volume of 360-degree
customer data can be useful to predict and hence proactively prevent chronic
diseases such as diabetes.

    <title>Investigating the Relationship Between World Development Indicators and
  the Occurrence of Disease Outbreaks in the 21st Century: A Case Study</title>
    <summary>  The timely identification of socio-economic sectors vulnerable to a disease
outbreak presents an important challenge to the civic authorities and
healthcare workers interested in outbreak mitigation measures. This problem was
traditionally solved by studying the aberrances in small-scale healthcare data.
In this paper, we leverage data driven models to determine the relationship
between the trends of World Development Indicators and occurrence of disease
outbreaks using worldwide historical data from 2000-2019, and treat it as a
classic supervised classification problem. CART based feature selection was
employed in an unorthodox fashion to determine the covariates getting affected
by the disease outbreak, thus giving the most vulnerable sectors. The result
involves a comprehensive analysis of different classification algorithms and is
indicative of the relationship between the disease outbreak occurrence and the
magnitudes of various development indicators.

    <title>Digital Twins for Patient Care via Knowledge Graphs and Closed-Form
  Continuous-Time Liquid Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Digital twin technology has is anticipated to transform healthcare, enabling
personalized medicines and support, earlier diagnoses, simulated treatment
outcomes, and optimized surgical plans. Digital twins are readily gaining
traction in industries like manufacturing, supply chain logistics, and civil
infrastructure. Not in patient care, however. The challenge of modeling complex
diseases with multimodal patient data and the computational complexities of
analyzing it have stifled digital twin adoption in the biomedical vertical.
Yet, these major obstacles can potentially be handled by approaching these
models in a different way. This paper proposes a novel framework for addressing
the barriers to clinical twin modeling created by computational costs and
modeling complexities. We propose structuring patient health data as a
knowledge graph and using closed-form continuous-time liquid neural networks,
for real-time analytics. By synthesizing multimodal patient data and leveraging
the flexibility and efficiency of closed form continuous time networks and
knowledge graph ontologies, our approach enables real time insights,
personalized medicine, early diagnosis and intervention, and optimal surgical
planning. This novel approach provides a comprehensive and adaptable view of
patient health along with real-time analytics, paving the way for digital twin
simulations and other anticipated benefits in healthcare.

    <title>Transforming Dental Diagnostics with Artificial Intelligence: Advanced
  Integration of ChatGPT and Large Language Models for Patient Care</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence has dramatically reshaped our interaction with
digital technologies, ushering in an era where advancements in AI algorithms
and Large Language Models (LLMs) have natural language processing (NLP) systems
like ChatGPT. This study delves into the impact of cutting-edge LLMs, notably
OpenAI's ChatGPT, on medical diagnostics, with a keen focus on the dental
sector. Leveraging publicly accessible datasets, these models augment the
diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals, streamline communication
between patients and healthcare providers, and enhance the efficiency of
clinical procedures. The advent of ChatGPT-4 is poised to make substantial
inroads into dental practices, especially in the realm of oral surgery. This
paper sheds light on the current landscape and explores potential future
research directions in the burgeoning field of LLMs, offering valuable insights
for both practitioners and developers. Furthermore, it critically assesses the
broad implications and challenges within various sectors, including academia
and healthcare, thus mapping out an overview of AI's role in transforming
dental diagnostics for enhanced patient care.

    <title>Feature Selection Based on Unique Relevant Information for Health Data</title>
    <summary>  Feature selection, which searches for the most representative features in
observed data, is critical for health data analysis. Unlike feature extraction,
such as PCA and autoencoder based methods, feature selection preserves
interpretability, meaning that the selected features provide direct information
about certain health conditions (i.e., the label). Thus, feature selection
allows domain experts, such as clinicians, to understand the predictions made
by machine learning based systems, as well as improve their own diagnostic
skills. Mutual information is often used as a basis for feature selection since
it measures dependencies between features and labels. In this paper, we
introduce a novel mutual information based feature selection (MIBFS) method
called SURI, which boosts features with high unique relevant information. We
compare SURI to existing MIBFS methods using 3 different classifiers on 6
publicly available healthcare data sets. The results indicate that, in addition
to preserving interpretability, SURI selects more relevant feature subsets
which lead to higher classification performance. More importantly, we explore
the dynamics of mutual information on a public low-dimensional health data set
via exhaustive search. The results suggest the important role of unique
relevant information in feature selection and verify the principles behind
SURI.

    <title>Towards Automatic &amp; Personalised Mobile Health Interventions: An
  Interactive Machine Learning Perspective</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing field in computer science and
healthcare, providing future benefits in improved medical diagnoses, disease
analyses and prevention. In this paper, we introduce an application of
interactive machine learning (iML) in a telemedicine system, to enable
automatic and personalised interventions for lifestyle promotion. We first
present the high level architecture of the system and the components forming
the overall architecture. We then illustrate the interactive machine learning
process design. Prediction models are expected to be trained through the
participants' profiles, activity performance, and feedback from the caregiver.
Finally, we show some preliminary results during the system implementation and
discuss future directions. We envisage the proposed system to be digitally
implemented, and behaviourally designed to promote healthy lifestyle and
activities, and hence prevent users from the risk of chronic diseases.

    <title>Prediction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases from electronic
  health records using multi-task gated recurrent units</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we propose a multi-task recurrent neural network with attention
mechanism for predicting cardiovascular events from electronic health records
(EHRs) at different time horizons. The proposed approach is compared to a
standard clinical risk predictor (QRISK) and machine learning alternatives
using 5-year data from a NHS Foundation Trust. The proposed model outperforms
standard clinical risk scores in predicting stroke (AUC=0.85) and myocardial
infarction (AUC=0.89), considering the largest time horizon. Benefit of using
an \gls{mt} setting becomes visible for very short time horizons, which results
in an AUC increase between 2-6%. Further, we explored the importance of
individual features and attention weights in predicting cardiovascular events.
Our results indicate that the recurrent neural network approach benefits from
the hospital longitudinal information and demonstrates how machine learning
techniques can be applied to secondary care.

    <title>S-LIME: Stabilized-LIME for Model Explanation</title>
    <summary>  An increasing number of machine learning models have been deployed in domains
with high stakes such as finance and healthcare. Despite their superior
performances, many models are black boxes in nature which are hard to explain.
There are growing efforts for researchers to develop methods to interpret these
black-box models. Post hoc explanations based on perturbations, such as LIME,
are widely used approaches to interpret a machine learning model after it has
been built. This class of methods has been shown to exhibit large instability,
posing serious challenges to the effectiveness of the method itself and harming
user trust. In this paper, we propose S-LIME, which utilizes a hypothesis
testing framework based on central limit theorem for determining the number of
perturbation points needed to guarantee stability of the resulting explanation.
Experiments on both simulated and real world data sets are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    <title>Actor Critic with Differentially Private Critic</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning algorithms are known to be sample inefficient, and
often performance on one task can be substantially improved by leveraging
information (e.g., via pre-training) on other related tasks. In this work, we
propose a technique to achieve such knowledge transfer in cases where agent
trajectories contain sensitive or private information, such as in the
healthcare domain. Our approach leverages a differentially private policy
evaluation algorithm to initialize an actor-critic model and improve the
effectiveness of learning in downstream tasks. We empirically show this
technique increases sample efficiency in resource-constrained control problems
while preserving the privacy of trajectories collected in an upstream task.

    <title>Transfer Learning for Real-time Deployment of a Screening Tool for
  Depression Detection Using Actigraphy</title>
    <summary>  Automated depression screening and diagnosis is a highly relevant problem
today. There are a number of limitations of the traditional depression
detection methods, namely, high dependence on clinicians and biased
self-reporting. In recent years, research has suggested strong potential in
machine learning (ML) based methods that make use of the user's passive data
collected via wearable devices. However, ML is data hungry. Especially in the
healthcare domain primary data collection is challenging. In this work, we
present an approach based on transfer learning, from a model trained on a
secondary dataset, for the real time deployment of the depression screening
tool based on the actigraphy data of users. This approach enables machine
learning modelling even with limited primary data samples. A modified version
of leave one out cross validation approach performed on the primary set
resulted in mean accuracy of 0.96, where in each iteration one subject's data
from the primary set was set aside for testing.

    <title>Towards Vision-Based Smart Hospitals: A System for Tracking and
  Monitoring Hand Hygiene Compliance</title>
    <summary>  One in twenty-five patients admitted to a hospital will suffer from a
hospital acquired infection. If we can intelligently track healthcare staff,
patients, and visitors, we can better understand the sources of such
infections. We envision a smart hospital capable of increasing operational
efficiency and improving patient care with less spending. In this paper, we
propose a non-intrusive vision-based system for tracking people's activity in
hospitals. We evaluate our method for the problem of measuring hand hygiene
compliance. Empirically, our method outperforms existing solutions such as
proximity-based techniques and covert in-person observational studies. We
present intuitive, qualitative results that analyze human movement patterns and
conduct spatial analytics which convey our method's interpretability. This work
is a step towards a computer-vision based smart hospital and demonstrates
promising results for reducing hospital acquired infections.

    <title>ECOL: Early Detection of COVID Lies Using Content, Prior Knowledge and
  Source Information</title>
    <summary>  Social media platforms are vulnerable to fake news dissemination, which
causes negative consequences such as panic and wrong medication in the
healthcare domain. Therefore, it is important to automatically detect fake news
in an early stage before they get widely spread. This paper analyzes the impact
of incorporating content information, prior knowledge, and credibility of
sources into models for the early detection of fake news. We propose a
framework modeling those features by using BERT language model and external
sources, namely Simple English Wikipedia and source reliability tags. The
conducted experiments on CONSTRAINT datasets demonstrated the benefit of
integrating these features for the early detection of fake news in the
healthcare domain.

    <title>Computerization of Clinical Pathways: A Literature Review and Directions
  for Future Research</title>
    <summary>  Clinical Pathways (CP) are medical management plans developed to standardize
patient treatment activities, optimize resource usage, reduce expenses, and
improve the quality of healthcare services. Most CPs currently in use are
paper-based documents (i.e., not computerized). CP computerization has been an
active research topic since the inception of CP use in hospitals. This
literature review research aims to examine studies that focused on CP
computerization and offers recommendations for future research in this
important research area. Some critical research suggestions include
centralizing computerized CPs in Healthcare Information Systems (HIS), CP term
standardization using international medical terminology systems, developing a
global CP-specific digital coding system, creating a unified CP meta-ontology,
developing independent Clinical Pathway Management Systems (CPMS), and
supporting CPMSs with machine learning sub-systems.

    <title>Predicting User-specific Future Activities using LSTM-based Multi-label
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  User-specific future activity prediction in the healthcare domain based on
previous activities can drastically improve the services provided by the
nurses. It is challenging because, unlike other domains, activities in
healthcare involve both nurses and patients, and they also vary from hour to
hour. In this paper, we employ various data processing techniques to organize
and modify the data structure and an LSTM-based multi-label classifier for a
novel 2-stage training approach (user-agnostic pre-training and user-specific
fine-tuning). Our experiment achieves a validation accuracy of 31.58\%,
precision 57.94%, recall 68.31%, and F1 score 60.38%. We concluded that proper
data pre-processing and a 2-stage training process resulted in better
performance. This experiment is a part of the "Fourth Nurse Care Activity
Recognition Challenge" by our team "Not A Fan of Local Minima".

    <title>A Revolution of Personalized Healthcare: Enabling Human Digital Twin
  with Mobile AIGC</title>
    <summary>  Mobile Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) technology refers to
the adoption of AI algorithms deployed at mobile edge networks to automate the
information creation process while fulfilling the requirements of end users.
Mobile AIGC has recently attracted phenomenal attentions and can be a key
enabling technology for an emerging application, called human digital twin
(HDT). HDT empowered by the mobile AIGC is expected to revolutionize the
personalized healthcare by generating rare disease data, modeling high-fidelity
digital twin, building versatile testbeds, and providing 24/7 customized
medical services. To promote the development of this new breed of paradigm, in
this article, we propose a system architecture of mobile AIGC-driven HDT and
highlight the corresponding design requirements and challenges. Moreover, we
illustrate two use cases, i.e., mobile AIGC-driven HDT in customized surgery
planning and personalized medication. In addition, we conduct an experimental
study to prove the effectiveness of the proposed mobile AIGC-driven HDT
solution, which shows a particular application in a virtual physical therapy
teaching platform. Finally, we conclude this article by briefly discussing
several open issues and future directions.

    <title>Health Disparities through Generative AI Models: A Comparison Study
  Using A Domain Specific large language model</title>
    <summary>  Health disparities are differences in health outcomes and access to
healthcare between different groups, including racial and ethnic minorities,
low-income people, and rural residents. An artificial intelligence (AI) program
called large language models (LLMs) can understand and generate human language,
improving health communication and reducing health disparities. There are many
challenges in using LLMs in human-doctor interaction, including the need for
diverse and representative data, privacy concerns, and collaboration between
healthcare providers and technology experts. We introduce the comparative
investigation of domain-specific large language models such as SciBERT with a
multi-purpose LLMs BERT. We used cosine similarity to analyze text queries
about health disparities in exam rooms when factors such as race are used
alone. Using text queries, SciBERT fails when it doesn't differentiate between
queries text: "race" alone and "perpetuates health disparities." We believe
clinicians can use generative AI to create a draft response when communicating
asynchronously with patients. However, careful attention must be paid to ensure
they are developed and implemented ethically and equitably.

    <title>Would You Trust an AI Doctor? Building Reliable Medical Predictions with
  Kernel Dropout Uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  The growing capabilities of AI raise questions about their trustworthiness in
healthcare, particularly due to opaque decision-making and limited data
availability. This paper proposes a novel approach to address these challenges,
introducing a Bayesian Monte Carlo Dropout model with kernel modelling. Our
model is designed to enhance reliability on small medical datasets, a crucial
barrier to the wider adoption of AI in healthcare. This model leverages
existing language models for improved effectiveness and seamlessly integrates
with current workflows. We demonstrate significant improvements in reliability,
even with limited data, offering a promising step towards building trust in
AI-driven medical predictions and unlocking its potential to improve patient
care.

    <title>All of the Fairness for Edge Prediction with Optimal Transport</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning and data mining algorithms have been increasingly used
recently to support decision-making systems in many areas of high societal
importance such as healthcare, education, or security. While being very
efficient in their predictive abilities, the deployed algorithms sometimes tend
to learn an inductive model with a discriminative bias due to the presence of
this latter in the learning sample. This problem gave rise to a new field of
algorithmic fairness where the goal is to correct the discriminative bias
introduced by a certain attribute in order to decorrelate it from the model's
output. In this paper, we study the problem of fairness for the task of edge
prediction in graphs, a largely underinvestigated scenario compared to a more
popular setting of fair classification. To this end, we formulate the problem
of fair edge prediction, analyze it theoretically, and propose an
embedding-agnostic repairing procedure for the adjacency matrix of an arbitrary
graph with a trade-off between the group and individual fairness. We
experimentally show the versatility of our approach and its capacity to provide
explicit control over different notions of fairness and prediction accuracy.

    <title>Personalized and Reliable Decision Sets: Enhancing Interpretability in
  Clinical Decision Support Systems</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we present a novel clinical decision support system and
discuss its interpretability-related properties. It combines a decision set of
rules with a machine learning scheme to offer global and local
interpretability. More specifically, machine learning is used to predict the
likelihood of each of those rules to be correct for a particular patient, which
may also contribute to better predictive performances. Moreover, the
reliability analysis of individual predictions is also addressed, contributing
to further personalized interpretability. The combination of these several
elements may be crucial to obtain the clinical stakeholders' trust, leading to
a better assessment of patients' conditions and improvement of the physicians'
decision-making.

    <title>Quantifying machine learning-induced overdiagnosis in sepsis</title>
    <summary>  The proliferation of early diagnostic technologies, including self-monitoring
systems and wearables, coupled with the application of these technologies on
large segments of healthy populations may significantly aggravate the problem
of overdiagnosis. This can lead to unwanted consequences such as overloading
health care systems and overtreatment, with potential harms to healthy
individuals. The advent of machine-learning tools to assist diagnosis -- while
promising rapid and more personalised patient management and screening -- might
contribute to this issue. The identification of overdiagnosis is usually post
hoc and demonstrated after long periods (from years to decades) and costly
randomised control trials. In this paper, we present an innovative approach
that allows us to preemptively detect potential cases of overdiagnosis during
predictive model development. This approach is based on the combination of
labels obtained from a prediction model and clustered medical trajectories,
using sepsis in adults as a test case. This is one of the first attempts to
quantify machine-learning induced overdiagnosis and we believe will serves as a
platform for further development, leading to guidelines for safe deployment of
computational diagnostic tools.

    <title>Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make
diagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an
intuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.
These drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data
and make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world
patient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.
Next, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model
(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen
discomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by
using mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results
show reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort
drawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM
given a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The
positive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be
used for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support
system for physicians and other health care personnel.

    <title>Performance Evaluation of Serverless Edge Computing for Machine Learning
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Next generation technologies such as smart healthcare, self-driving cars, and
smart cities require new approaches to deal with the network traffic generated
by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as efficient programming
models to deploy machine learning techniques. Serverless edge computing is an
emerging computing paradigm from the integration of two recent technologies,
edge computing and serverless computing, that can possibly address these
challenges. However, there is little work to explore the capability and
performance of such a technology. In this paper, a comprehensive performance
analysis of a serverless edge computing system using popular open-source
frameworks, namely, Kubeless, OpenFaaS, Fission, and funcX is presented. The
experiments considered different programming languages, workloads, and the
number of concurrent users. The machine learning workloads have been used to
evaluate the performance of the system under different working conditions to
provide insights into the best practices. The evaluation results revealed some
of the current challenges in serverless edge computing and open research
opportunities in this emerging technology for machine learning applications.

    <title>TabText: A Flexible and Contextual Approach to Tabular Data
  Representation</title>
    <summary>  Tabular data is essential for applying machine learning tasks across various
industries. However, traditional data processing methods do not fully utilize
all the information available in the tables, ignoring important contextual
information such as column header descriptions. In addition, pre-processing
data into a tabular format can remain a labor-intensive bottleneck in model
development. This work introduces TabText, a processing and feature extraction
framework that extracts contextual information from tabular data structures.
TabText addresses processing difficulties by converting the content into
language and utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
our framework on nine healthcare prediction tasks ranging from patient
discharge, ICU admission, and mortality. We show that 1) applying our TabText
framework enables the generation of high-performing and simple machine learning
baseline models with minimal data pre-processing, and 2) augmenting
pre-processed tabular data with TabText representations improves the average
and worst-case AUC performance of standard machine learning models by as much
as 6%.

    <title>Activity2Vec: Learning ADL Embeddings from Sensor Data with a
  Sequence-to-Sequence Model</title>
    <summary>  Recognizing activities of daily living (ADLs) plays an essential role in
analyzing human health and behavior. The widespread availability of sensors
implanted in homes, smartphones, and smart watches have engendered collection
of big datasets that reflect human behavior. To obtain a machine learning model
based on these data,researchers have developed multiple feature extraction
methods. In this study, we investigate a method for automatically extracting
universal and meaningful features that are applicable across similar time
series-based learning tasks such as activity recognition and fall detection. We
propose creating a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to perform this feature
learning. Beside avoiding feature engineering, the meaningful features learned
by the seq2seq model can also be utilized for semi-supervised learning. We
evaluate both of these benefits on datasets collected from wearable and ambient
sensors.

    <title>Deep Contextual Clinical Prediction with Reverse Distillation</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare providers are increasingly using machine learning to predict
patient outcomes to make meaningful interventions. However, despite innovations
in this area, deep learning models often struggle to match performance of
shallow linear models in predicting these outcomes, making it difficult to
leverage such techniques in practice. In this work, motivated by the task of
clinical prediction from insurance claims, we present a new technique called
Reverse Distillation which pretrains deep models by using high-performing
linear models for initialization. We make use of the longitudinal structure of
insurance claims datasets to develop Self Attention with Reverse Distillation,
or SARD, an architecture that utilizes a combination of contextual embedding,
temporal embedding and self-attention mechanisms and most critically is trained
via reverse distillation. SARD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple
clinical prediction outcomes, with ablation studies revealing that reverse
distillation is a primary driver of these improvements. Code is available at
https://github.com/clinicalml/omop-learn.

    <title>Phenotyping with Positive Unlabelled Learning for Genome-Wide
  Association Studies</title>
    <summary>  Identifying phenotypes plays an important role in furthering our
understanding of disease biology through practical applications within
healthcare and the life sciences. The challenge of dealing with the
complexities and noise within electronic health records (EHRs) has motivated
applications of machine learning in phenotypic discovery. While recent research
has focused on finding predictive subtypes for clinical decision support, here
we instead focus on the noise that results in phenotypic misclassification,
which can reduce a phenotypes ability to detect associations in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). We show that by combining anchor learning and
transformer architectures into our proposed model, AnchorBERT, we are able to
detect genomic associations only previously found in large consortium studies
with 5$\times$ more cases. When reducing the number of controls available by
50\%, we find our model is able to maintain 40\% more significant genomic
associations from the GWAS catalog compared to standard phenotype definitions.

    <title>Exploring the Practicality of Federated Learning: A Survey Towards the
  Communication Perspective</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that offers significant
advancements in privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning by enabling
collaborative training of models across distributed devices without
centralizing data. However, the practical deployment of FL systems faces a
significant bottleneck: the communication overhead caused by frequently
exchanging large model updates between numerous devices and a central server.
This communication inefficiency can hinder training speed, model performance,
and the overall feasibility of real-world FL applications. In this survey, we
investigate various strategies and advancements made in communication-efficient
FL, highlighting their impact and potential to overcome the communication
challenges inherent in FL systems. Specifically, we define measures for
communication efficiency, analyze sources of communication inefficiency in FL
systems, and provide a taxonomy and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art
communication-efficient FL methods. Additionally, we discuss promising future
research directions for enhancing the communication efficiency of FL systems.
By addressing the communication bottleneck, FL can be effectively applied and
enable scalable and practical deployment across diverse applications that
require privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning, such as IoT,
healthcare, or finance.

    <title>Feature selection for gesture recognition in Internet-of-Things for
  healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Internet of Things is rapidly spreading across several fields, including
healthcare, posing relevant questions related to communication capabilities,
energy efficiency and sensors unobtrusiveness. Particularly, in the context of
recognition of gestures, e.g., grasping of different objects, brain and
muscular activity could be simultaneously recorded via EEG and EMG,
respectively, and analyzed to identify the gesture that is being accomplished,
and the quality of its performance. This paper proposes a new algorithm that
aims (i) to robustly extract the most relevant features to classify different
grasping tasks, and (ii) to retain the natural meaning of the selected
features. This, in turn, gives the opportunity to simplify the recording setup
to minimize the data traffic over the communication network, including
Internet, and provide physiologically significant features for medical
interpretation. The algorithm robustness is ensured both by consensus
clustering as a feature selection strategy, and by nested cross-validation
scheme to evaluate its classification performance.

    <title>Bio+Clinical BERT, BERT Base, and CNN Performance Comparison for
  Predicting Drug-Review Satisfaction</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this study is to develop natural language processing (NLP)
models that can analyze patients' drug reviews and accurately classify their
satisfaction levels as positive, neutral, or negative. Such models would reduce
the workload of healthcare professionals and provide greater insight into
patients' quality of life, which is a critical indicator of treatment
effectiveness. To achieve this, we implemented and evaluated several
classification models, including a BERT base model, Bio+Clinical BERT, and a
simpler CNN. Results indicate that the medical domain-specific Bio+Clinical
BERT model significantly outperformed the general domain base BERT model,
achieving macro f1 and recall score improvement of 11%, as shown in Table 2.
Future research could explore how to capitalize on the specific strengths of
each model. Bio+Clinical BERT excels in overall performance, particularly with
medical jargon, while the simpler CNN demonstrates the ability to identify
crucial words and accurately classify sentiment in texts with conflicting
sentiments.

    <title>Patient Clustering via Integrated Profiling of Clinical and Digital Data</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a novel profile-based patient clustering model designed for
clinical data in healthcare. By utilizing a method grounded on constrained
low-rank approximation, our model takes advantage of patients' clinical data
and digital interaction data, including browsing and search, to construct
patient profiles. As a result of the method, nonnegative embedding vectors are
generated, serving as a low-dimensional representation of the patients. Our
model was assessed using real-world patient data from a healthcare web portal,
with a comprehensive evaluation approach which considered clustering and
recommendation capabilities. In comparison to other baselines, our approach
demonstrated superior performance in terms of clustering coherence and
recommendation accuracy.

    <title>Enhancing Healthcare with EOG: A Novel Approach to Sleep Stage
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an innovative approach to automated sleep stage classification
using EOG signals, addressing the discomfort and impracticality associated with
EEG data acquisition. In addition, it is important to note that this approach
is untapped in the field, highlighting its potential for novel insights and
contributions. Our proposed SE-Resnet-Transformer model provides an accurate
classification of five distinct sleep stages from raw EOG signal. Extensive
validation on publically available databases (SleepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and
SHHS) reveals noteworthy performance, with macro-F1 scores of 74.72, 70.63, and
69.26, respectively. Our model excels in identifying REM sleep, a crucial
aspect of sleep disorder investigations. We also provide insight into the
internal mechanisms of our model using techniques such as 1D-GradCAM and t-SNE
plots. Our method improves the accessibility of sleep stage classification
while decreasing the need for EEG modalities. This development will have
promising implications for healthcare and the incorporation of wearable
technology into sleep studies, thereby advancing the field's potential for
enhanced diagnostics and patient comfort.

    <title>Data Poisoning Attacks on Off-Policy Policy Evaluation Methods</title>
    <summary>  Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are a crucial tool for evaluating
policies in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where exploration is often
infeasible, unethical, or expensive. However, the extent to which such methods
can be trusted under adversarial threats to data quality is largely unexplored.
In this work, we make the first attempt at investigating the sensitivity of OPE
methods to marginal adversarial perturbations to the data. We design a generic
data poisoning attack framework leveraging influence functions from robust
statistics to carefully construct perturbations that maximize error in the
policy value estimates. We carry out extensive experimentation with multiple
healthcare and control datasets. Our results demonstrate that many existing OPE
methods are highly prone to generating value estimates with large errors when
subject to data poisoning attacks, even for small adversarial perturbations.
These findings question the reliability of policy values derived using OPE
methods and motivate the need for developing OPE methods that are statistically
robust to train-time data poisoning attacks.

    <title>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for Building Intelligent
  Systems in Medicine and Drug Discovery: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
    <summary>  With the advancements in computer technology, there is a rapid development of
intelligent systems to understand the complex relationships in data to make
predictions and classifications. Artificail Intelligence based framework is
rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry. These intelligent systems are
built with machine learning and deep learning based robust models for early
diagnosis of diseases and demonstrates a promising supplementary diagnostic
method for frontline clinical doctors and surgeons. Machine Learning and Deep
Learning based systems can streamline and simplify the steps involved in
diagnosis of diseases from clinical and image-based data, thus providing
significant clinician support and workflow optimization. They mimic human
cognition and are even capable of diagnosing diseases that cannot be diagnosed
with human intelligence. This paper focuses on the survey of machine learning
and deep learning applications in across 16 medical specialties, namely Dental
medicine, Haematology, Surgery, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Orthopedics,
Radiology, Oncology, General medicine, Psychiatry, Endocrinology, Neurology,
Dermatology, Hepatology, Nephrology, Ophthalmology, and Drug discovery. In this
paper along with the survey, we discuss the advancements of medical practices
with these systems and also the impact of these systems on medical
professionals.

    <title>Decentralized Healthcare Systems with Federated Learning and Blockchain</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques have gained
significant attraction in recent years, owing to their remarkable capability of
achieving high performance across a broad range of applications. However, a
crucial challenge in training such models is the acquisition of vast amounts of
data, which is often limited in fields like healthcare. In this domain, medical
data is typically scattered across various sources such as hospitals, clinics,
and wearable devices. The aggregated data collected from multiple sources in
the healthcare domain is sufficient for training advanced deep learning models.
However, these sources are frequently hesitant to share such data due to
privacy considerations. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed
the integration of blockchain and federated learning to develop a system that
facilitates the secure sharing of medical records. This work provides a
succinct review of the current state of the art in the use of blockchain and
federated learning in the decentralized healthcare domain.

    <title>Serverless on FHIR: Deploying machine learning models for healthcare on
  the cloud</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) plays a vital role in implementing digital health. The
advances in hardware and the democratization of software tools have
revolutionized machine learning. However, the deployment of ML models -- the
mathematical representation of the task to be performed -- for effective and
efficient clinical decision support at the point of care is still a challenge.
ML models undergo constant improvement of their accuracy and predictive power
with a high turnover rate. Updating models consumed by downstream health
information systems is essential for patient safety. We introduce a functional
taxonomy and a four-tier architecture for cloud-based model deployment for
digital health. The four tiers are containerized microservices for
maintainability, serverless architecture for scalability, function as a service
for portability and FHIR schema for discoverability. We call this architecture
Serverless on FHIR and propose this as a standard to deploy digital health
applications that can be consumed by downstream systems such as EMRs and
visualization tools.

    <title>Classification of Pneumonia and Tuberculosis from Chest X-rays</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically machine learning is making
inroads into number of fields. Machine learning is replacing and/or
complementing humans in a certain type of domain to make systems perform tasks
more efficiently and independently. Healthcare is a worthy domain to merge with
AI and Machine learning to get things to work smoother and efficiently. The
X-ray based detection and classification of diseases related to chest is much
needed in this modern era due to the low number of quality radiologists. This
thesis focuses on the classification of Pneumonia and Tuberculosis two major
chest diseases from the chest X-rays. This system provides an opinion to the
user whether one is having a disease or not, thereby helping doctors and
medical staff to make a quick and informed decision about the presence of
disease. As compared to previous work our model can detect two types of
abnormality. Our model can detect whether X-ray is normal or having abnormality
which can be pneumonia and tuberculosis 92.97% accurately.

    <title>Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Notes: From Human Coders to
  Machines</title>
    <summary>  Prediction of medical codes from clinical notes is a practical and essential
need for every healthcare delivery organization within current medical systems.
Automating annotation will save significant time and excessive effort that
human coders spend today. However, the biggest challenge is directly
identifying appropriate medical codes from several thousands of
high-dimensional codes from unstructured free-text clinical notes. This complex
medical codes prediction problem from clinical notes has received substantial
interest in the NLP community, and several recent studies have shown the
state-of-the-art code prediction results of full-fledged deep learning-based
methods. This progress raises the fundamental question of how far automated
machine learning systems are from human coders' working performance, as well as
the important question of how well current explainability methods apply to
advanced neural network models such as transformers. This is to predict correct
codes and present references in clinical notes that support code prediction, as
this level of explainability and accuracy of the prediction outcomes is
critical to gaining trust from professional medical coders.

    <title>Screening of Pneumonia and Urinary Tract Infection at Triage using
  TriNet</title>
    <summary>  Due to the steady rise in population demographics and longevity, emergency
department visits are increasing across North America. As more patients visit
the emergency department, traditional clinical workflows become overloaded and
inefficient, leading to prolonged wait-times and reduced healthcare quality.
One of such workflows is the triage medical directive, impeded by limited human
workload, inaccurate diagnoses and invasive over-testing. To address this
issue, we propose TriNet: a machine learning model for medical directives that
automates first-line screening at triage for conditions requiring downstream
testing for diagnosis confirmation. To verify screening potential, TriNet was
trained on hospital triage data and achieved high positive predictive values in
detecting pneumonia (0.86) and urinary tract infection (0.93). These models
outperform current clinical benchmarks, indicating that machine-learning
medical directives can offer cost-free, non-invasive screening with high
specificity for common conditions, reducing the risk of over-testing while
increasing emergency department efficiency.

    <title>From Free Text to Clusters of Content in Health Records: An Unsupervised
  Graph Partitioning Approach</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Healthcare records contain large volumes of unstructured data in
different forms. Free text constitutes a large portion of such data, yet this
source of richly detailed information often remains under-used in practice
because of a lack of suitable methodologies to extract interpretable content in
a timely manner. Here we apply network-theoretical tools to the analysis of
free text in Hospital Patient Incident reports in the English National Health
Service, to find clusters of reports in an unsupervised manner and at different
levels of resolution based directly on the free text descriptions contained
within them. To do so, we combine recently developed deep neural network
text-embedding methodologies based on paragraph vectors with multi-scale Markov
Stability community detection applied to a similarity graph of documents
obtained from sparsified text vector similarities. We showcase the approach
with the analysis of incident reports submitted in Imperial College Healthcare
NHS Trust, London. The multiscale community structure reveals levels of meaning
with different resolution in the topics of the dataset, as shown by relevant
descriptive terms extracted from the groups of records, as well as by comparing
a posteriori against hand-coded categories assigned by healthcare personnel.
Our content communities exhibit good correspondence with well-defined
hand-coded categories, yet our results also provide further medical detail in
certain areas as well as revealing complementary descriptors of incidents
beyond the external classification. We also discuss how the method can be used
to monitor reports over time and across different healthcare providers, and to
detect emerging trends that fall outside of pre-existing categories.

    <title>Markov Decision Processes with Continuous Side Information</title>
    <summary>  We consider a reinforcement learning (RL) setting in which the agent
interacts with a sequence of episodic MDPs. At the start of each episode the
agent has access to some side-information or context that determines the
dynamics of the MDP for that episode. Our setting is motivated by applications
in healthcare where baseline measurements of a patient at the start of a
treatment episode form the context that may provide information about how the
patient might respond to treatment decisions. We propose algorithms for
learning in such Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under an
assumption that the unobserved MDP parameters vary smoothly with the observed
context. We also give lower and upper PAC bounds under the smoothness
assumption. Because our lower bound has an exponential dependence on the
dimension, we consider a tractable linear setting where the context is used to
create linear combinations of a finite set of MDPs. For the linear setting, we
give a PAC learning algorithm based on KWIK learning techniques.

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Differential Privacy</title>
    <summary>  The offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem is often motivated by the
need to learn data-driven decision policies in financial, legal and healthcare
applications. However, the learned policy could retain sensitive information of
individuals in the training data (e.g., treatment and outcome of patients),
thus susceptible to various privacy risks. We design offline RL algorithms with
differential privacy guarantees which provably prevent such risks. These
algorithms also enjoy strong instance-dependent learning bounds under both
tabular and linear Markov decision process (MDP) settings. Our theory and
simulation suggest that the privacy guarantee comes at (almost) no drop in
utility comparing to the non-private counterpart for a medium-size dataset.

    <title>A Variational Autoencoder for Heterogeneous Temporal and Longitudinal
  Data</title>
    <summary>  The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular deep latent variable model
used to analyse high-dimensional datasets by learning a low-dimensional latent
representation of the data. It simultaneously learns a generative model and an
inference network to perform approximate posterior inference. Recently proposed
extensions to VAEs that can handle temporal and longitudinal data have
applications in healthcare, behavioural modelling, and predictive maintenance.
However, these extensions do not account for heterogeneous data (i.e., data
comprising of continuous and discrete attributes), which is common in many
real-life applications. In this work, we propose the heterogeneous longitudinal
VAE (HL-VAE) that extends the existing temporal and longitudinal VAEs to
heterogeneous data. HL-VAE provides efficient inference for high-dimensional
datasets and includes likelihood models for continuous, count, categorical, and
ordinal data while accounting for missing observations. We demonstrate our
model's efficacy through simulated as well as clinical datasets, and show that
our proposed model achieves competitive performance in missing value imputation
and predictive accuracy.

    <title>Daily Physical Activity Monitoring -- Adaptive Learning from
  Multi-source Motion Sensor Data</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare applications, there is a growing need to develop machine
learning models that use data from a single source, such as that from a wrist
wearable device, to monitor physical activities, assess health risks, and
provide immediate health recommendations or interventions. However, the
limitation of using single-source data often compromises the model's accuracy,
as it fails to capture the full scope of human activities. While a more
comprehensive dataset can be gathered in a lab setting using multiple sensors
attached to various body parts, this approach is not practical for everyday use
due to the impracticality of wearing multiple sensors. To address this
challenge, we introduce a transfer learning framework that optimizes machine
learning models for everyday applications by leveraging multi-source data
collected in a laboratory setting. We introduce a novel metric to leverage the
inherent relationship between these multiple data sources, as they are all
paired to capture aspects of the same physical activity. Through numerical
experiments, our framework outperforms existing methods in classification
accuracy and robustness to noise, offering a promising avenue for the
enhancement of daily activity monitoring.

    <title>Multimodal Machine Learning in Image-Based and Clinical Biomedicine:
  Survey and Prospects</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) applications in medical artificial intelligence (AI)
systems have shifted from traditional and statistical methods to increasing
application of deep learning models. This survey navigates the current
landscape of multimodal ML, focusing on its profound impact on medical image
analysis and clinical decision support systems. Emphasizing challenges and
innovations in addressing multimodal representation, fusion, translation,
alignment, and co-learning, the paper explores the transformative potential of
multimodal models for clinical predictions. It also highlights the need for
principled assessments and practical implementation of such models, bringing
attention to the dynamics between decision support systems and healthcare
providers and personnel. Despite advancements, challenges such as data biases
and the scarcity of "big data" in many biomedical domains persist. We conclude
with a discussion on principled innovation and collaborative efforts to further
the mission of seamless integration of multimodal ML models into biomedical
practice.

    <title>Unmasking Bias in AI: A Systematic Review of Bias Detection and
  Mitigation Strategies in Electronic Health Record-based Models</title>
    <summary>  Objectives: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with
electronic health records (EHRs) holds transformative potential to improve
healthcare. Yet, addressing bias in AI, which risks worsening healthcare
disparities, cannot be overlooked. This study reviews methods to detect and
mitigate diverse forms of bias in AI models developed using EHR data. Methods:
We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing articles
from PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE published between January 1, 2010, and
Dec 17, 2023. The review identified key biases, outlined strategies for
detecting and mitigating bias throughout the AI model development process, and
analyzed metrics for bias assessment. Results: Of the 450 articles retrieved,
20 met our criteria, revealing six major bias types: algorithmic, confounding,
implicit, measurement, selection, and temporal. The AI models were primarily
developed for predictive tasks in healthcare settings. Four studies
concentrated on the detection of implicit and algorithmic biases employing
fairness metrics like statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive
equity. Sixty proposed various strategies for mitigating biases, especially
targeting implicit and selection biases. These strategies, evaluated through
both performance (e.g., accuracy, AUROC) and fairness metrics, predominantly
involved data collection and preprocessing techniques like resampling,
reweighting, and transformation. Discussion: This review highlights the varied
and evolving nature of strategies to address bias in EHR-based AI models,
emphasizing the urgent needs for the establishment of standardized,
generalizable, and interpretable methodologies to foster the creation of
ethical AI systems that promote fairness and equity in healthcare.

    <title>Automatic Documentation of ICD Codes with Far-Field Speech Recognition</title>
    <summary>  Documentation errors increase healthcare costs and cause unnecessary patient
deaths. As the standard language for diagnoses and billing, ICD codes serve as
the foundation for medical documentation worldwide. Despite the prevalence of
electronic medical records, hospitals still witness high levels of ICD
miscoding. In this paper, we propose to automatically document ICD codes with
far-field speech recognition. Far-field speech occurs when the microphone is
located several meters from the source, as is common with smart homes and
security systems. Our method combines acoustic signal processing with recurrent
neural networks to recognize and document ICD codes in real time. To evaluate
our model, we collected a far-field speech dataset of ICD-10 codes and found
our model to achieve 87% accuracy with a BLEU score of 85%. By sampling from an
unsupervised medical language model, our method is able to outperform existing
methods. Overall, this work shows the potential of automatic speech recognition
to provide efficient, accurate, and cost-effective healthcare documentation.

    <title>Understanding Perceptions and Attitudes in Breast Cancer Discussions on
  Twitter</title>
    <summary>  Among American women, the rate of breast cancer is only second to lung
cancer. An estimated 12.4% women will develop breast cancer over the course of
their lifetime. The widespread use of social media across the socio-economic
spectrum offers unparalleled ways to facilitate information sharing, in
particular as it pertains to health. Social media is also used by many
healthcare stakeholders, ranging from government agencies to healthcare
industry, to disseminate health information and to engage patients. The purpose
of this study is to investigate people's perceptions and attitudes relate to
breast cancer, especially those that are related to physical activities, on
Twitter. To achieve this, we first identified and collected tweets related to
breast cancer; and then used topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques
to understanding discussion themes and quantify Twitter users' perceptions and
emotions w.r.t breast cancer to answer 5 research questions.

    <title>A Review of Anonymization for Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Mining health data can lead to faster medical decisions, improvement in the
quality of treatment, disease prevention, reduced cost, and it drives
innovative solutions within the healthcare sector. However, health data is
highly sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), which aims to ensure patient's privacy. Anonymization or
removal of patient identifiable information, though the most conventional way,
is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and incorporate
privacy concerns. In this paper, we review the existing anonymization
techniques and their applicability to various types (relational and
graph-based) of health data. Besides, we provide an overview of possible
attacks on anonymized data. We illustrate via a reconstruction attack that
anonymization though necessary, is not sufficient to address patient privacy
and discuss methods for protecting against such attacks. Finally, we discuss
tools that can be used to achieve anonymization.

    <title>A Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing Framework for Infodemic
  Management</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on health systems which are
further strained due to the misinformation surrounding it. Under such a
situation, providing the right information at the right time is crucial. There
is a growing demand for the management of information spread using Artificial
Intelligence. Hence, we have exploited the potential of Natural Language
Processing for identifying relevant information that needs to be disseminated
amongst the masses. In this work, we present a novel Cross-lingual Natural
Language Processing framework to provide relevant information by matching daily
news with trusted guidelines from the World Health Organization. The proposed
pipeline deploys various techniques of NLP such as summarizers, word
embeddings, and similarity metrics to provide users with news articles along
with a corresponding healthcare guideline. A total of 36 models were evaluated
and a combination of LexRank based summarizer on Word2Vec embedding with Word
Mover distance metric outperformed all other models. This novel open-source
approach can be used as a template for proactive dissemination of relevant
healthcare information in the midst of misinformation spread associated with
epidemics.

    <title>A Visual Analytics Design for Connecting Healthcare Team Communication
  to Patient Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  Communication among healthcare professionals (HCPs) is crucial for the
quality of patient treatment. Surrounding each patient's treatment,
communication among HCPs can be examined as temporal networks, constructed from
Electronic Health Record (EHR) access logs. This paper introduces a visual
analytics system designed to study the effectiveness and efficiency of temporal
communication networks mediated by the EHR system. We present a method that
associates network measures with patient survival outcomes and devises
effectiveness metrics based on these associations. To analyze communication
efficiency, we extract the latencies and frequencies of EHR accesses. Our
visual analytics system is designed to assist in inspecting and understanding
the composed communication effectiveness metrics and to enable the exploration
of communication efficiency by encoding latencies and frequencies in an
information flow diagram. We demonstrate and evaluate our system through
multiple case studies and an expert review.

    <title>Effect of a Process Mining based Pre-processing Step in Prediction of
  the Critical Health Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  Predicting critical health outcomes such as patient mortality and hospital
readmission is essential for improving survivability. However, healthcare
datasets have many concurrences that create complexities, leading to poor
predictions. Consequently, pre-processing the data is crucial to improve its
quality. In this study, we use an existing pre-processing algorithm,
concatenation, to improve data quality by decreasing the complexity of
datasets. Sixteen healthcare datasets were extracted from two databases - MIMIC
III and University of Illinois Hospital - converted to the event logs, they
were then fed into the concatenation algorithm. The pre-processed event logs
were then fed to the Split Miner (SM) algorithm to produce a process model.
Process model quality was evaluated before and after concatenation using the
following metrics: fitness, precision, F-Measure, and complexity. The
pre-processed event logs were also used as inputs to the Decay Replay Mining
(DREAM) algorithm to predict critical outcomes. We compared predicted results
before and after applying the concatenation algorithm using Area Under the
Curve (AUC) and Confidence Intervals (CI). Results indicated that the
concatenation algorithm improved the quality of the process models and
predictions of the critical health outcomes.

    <title>Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Classification via Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this era of pandemic, the future of healthcare industry has never been
more exciting. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI &amp; ML) present
opportunities to develop solutions that cater for very specific needs within
the industry. Deep learning in healthcare had become incredibly powerful for
supporting clinics and in transforming patient care in general. Deep learning
is increasingly being applied for the detection of clinically important
features in the images beyond what can be perceived by the naked human eye.
Chest X-ray images are one of the most common clinical method for diagnosing a
number of diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer and many other abnormalities
like lesions and fractures. Proper diagnosis of a disease from X-ray images is
often challenging task for even expert radiologists and there is a growing need
for computerized support systems due to the large amount of information encoded
in X-Ray images. The goal of this paper is to develop a lightweight solution to
detect 14 different chest conditions from an X ray image. Given an X-ray image
as input, our classifier outputs a label vector indicating which of 14 disease
classes does the image fall into. Along with the image features, we are also
going to use non-image features available in the data such as X-ray view type,
age, gender etc. The original study conducted Stanford ML Group is our base
line. Original study focuses on predicting 5 diseases. Our aim is to improve
upon previous work, expand prediction to 14 diseases and provide insight for
future chest radiography research.

    <title>Early prediction of the risk of ICU mortality with Deep Federated
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Intensive Care Units usually carry patients with a serious risk of mortality.
Recent research has shown the ability of Machine Learning to indicate the
patients' mortality risk and point physicians toward individuals with a
heightened need for care. Nevertheless, healthcare data is often subject to
privacy regulations and can therefore not be easily shared in order to build
Centralized Machine Learning models that use the combined data of multiple
hospitals. Federated Learning is a Machine Learning framework designed for data
privacy that can be used to circumvent this problem. In this study, we evaluate
the ability of deep Federated Learning to predict the risk of Intensive Care
Unit mortality at an early stage. We compare the predictive performance of
Federated, Centralized, and Local Machine Learning in terms of AUPRC, F1-score,
and AUROC. Our results show that Federated Learning performs equally well as
the centralized approach and is substantially better than the local approach,
thus providing a viable solution for early Intensive Care Unit mortality
prediction. In addition, we show that the prediction performance is higher when
the patient history window is closer to discharge or death. Finally, we show
that using the F1-score as an early stopping metric can stabilize and increase
the performance of our approach for the task at hand.

    <title>Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Exploration of Explainable
  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Breast cancer (BC) stands as one of the most common malignancies affecting
women worldwide, necessitating advancements in diagnostic methodologies for
better clinical outcomes. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of
the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in the
detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. As Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technologies continue to permeate the healthcare sector, particularly in
oncology, the need for transparent and interpretable models becomes imperative
to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care. This review discusses the
integration of various XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and
others, with machine learning and deep learning models utilized in breast
cancer detection and classification. By investigating the modalities of breast
cancer datasets, including mammograms, ultrasounds and their processing with
AI, the paper highlights how XAI can lead to more accurate diagnoses and
personalized treatment plans. It also examines the challenges in implementing
these techniques and the importance of developing standardized metrics for
evaluating XAI's effectiveness in clinical settings. Through detailed analysis
and discussion, this article aims to highlight the potential of XAI in bridging
the gap between complex AI models and practical healthcare applications,
thereby fostering trust and understanding among medical professionals and
improving patient outcomes.

    <title>Net benefit, calibration, threshold selection, and training objectives
  for algorithmic fairness in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  A growing body of work uses the paradigm of algorithmic fairness to frame the
development of techniques to anticipate and proactively mitigate the
introduction or exacerbation of health inequities that may follow from the use
of model-guided decision-making. We evaluate the interplay between measures of
model performance, fairness, and the expected utility of decision-making to
offer practical recommendations for the operationalization of algorithmic
fairness principles for the development and evaluation of predictive models in
healthcare. We conduct an empirical case-study via development of models to
estimate the ten-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to inform
statin initiation in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. We
demonstrate that approaches that incorporate fairness considerations into the
model training objective typically do not improve model performance or confer
greater net benefit for any of the studied patient populations compared to the
use of standard learning paradigms followed by threshold selection concordant
with patient preferences, evidence of intervention effectiveness, and model
calibration. These results hold when the measured outcomes are not subject to
differential measurement error across patient populations and threshold
selection is unconstrained, regardless of whether differences in model
performance metrics, such as in true and false positive error rates, are
present. In closing, we argue for focusing model development efforts on
developing calibrated models that predict outcomes well for all patient
populations while emphasizing that such efforts are complementary to
transparent reporting, participatory design, and reasoning about the impact of
model-informed interventions in context.

    <title>UDAMA: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation through Multi-discriminator
  Adversarial Training with Noisy Labels Improves Cardio-fitness Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare
monitoring applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality
(gold-standard) labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is
often costly and time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on
small-scale datasets often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well
to unseen scenarios. At the same time, large amounts of imprecise
(silver-standard) labeled data, annotated by approximate methods with the help
of modern wearables and in the absence of ground truth validation, are starting
to emerge. However, due to measurement differences, this data displays
significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use of domain
adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components:
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multidiscriminator Adversarial Training,
where we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial
adaptation with the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In
particular, we showcase the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to
Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of
metabolic disease and mortality, and it presents labels with various levels of
noise (goldand silver-standard), making it challenging to establish an accurate
prediction model. Our results show promising performance by alleviating
distribution shifts in various label shift settings. Additionally, by using
data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS), we show that UDAMA
consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer learning
and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging
noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale.

    <title>A Tour of Unsupervised Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Interpretation of medical images for diagnosis and treatment of complex
disease from high-dimensional and heterogeneous data remains a key challenge in
transforming healthcare. In the last few years, both supervised and
unsupervised deep learning achieved promising results in the area of medical
imaging and image analysis. Unlike supervised learning which is biased towards
how it is being supervised and manual efforts to create class label for the
algorithm, unsupervised learning derive insights directly from the data itself,
group the data and help to make data driven decisions without any external
bias. This review systematically presents various unsupervised models applied
to medical image analysis, including autoencoders and its several variants,
Restricted Boltzmann machines, Deep belief networks, Deep Boltzmann machine and
Generative adversarial network. Future research opportunities and challenges of
unsupervised techniques for medical image analysis have also been discussed.

    <title>Unsupervised Representation for EHR Signals and Codes as Patient Status
  Vector</title>
    <summary>  Effective modeling of electronic health records presents many challenges as
they contain large amounts of irregularity most of which are due to the varying
procedures and diagnosis a patient may have. Despite the recent progress in
machine learning, unsupervised learning remains largely at open, especially in
the healthcare domain. In this work, we present a two-step unsupervised
representation learning scheme to summarize the multi-modal clinical time
series consisting of signals and medical codes into a patient status vector.
First, an auto-encoder step is used to reduce sparse medical codes and clinical
time series into a distributed representation. Subsequently, the concatenation
of the distributed representations is further fine-tuned using a forecasting
task. We evaluate the usefulness of the representation on two downstream tasks:
mortality and readmission. Our proposed method shows improved generalization
performance for both short duration ICU visits and long duration ICU visits.

    <summary>  The number of IoT devices in healthcare is expected to rise sharply due to
increased demand since the COVID-19 pandemic. Deep learning and IoT devices are
being employed to monitor body vitals and automate anomaly detection in
clinical and non-clinical settings. Most of the current technology requires the
transmission of raw data to a remote server, which is not efficient for
resource-constrained IoT devices and embedded systems. Additionally, it is
challenging to develop a machine learning model for ECG classification due to
the lack of an extensive open public database. To an extent, to overcome this
challenge PTB-XL dataset has been used. In this work, we have developed machine
learning models to be deployed on Raspberry Pi. We present an evaluation of our
TensorFlow Model with two classification classes. We also present the
evaluation of the corresponding TensorFlow Lite FlatBuffers to demonstrate
their minimal run-time requirements while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

    <title>Overview of Human Activity Recognition Using Sensor Data</title>
    <summary>  Human activity recognition (HAR) is an essential research field that has been
used in different applications including home and workplace automation,
security and surveillance as well as healthcare. Starting from conventional
machine learning methods to the recently developing deep learning techniques
and the Internet of things, significant contributions have been shown in the
HAR area in the last decade. Even though several review and survey studies have
been published, there is a lack of sensor-based HAR overview studies focusing
on summarising the usage of wearable sensors and smart home sensors data as
well as applications of HAR and deep learning techniques. Hence, we overview
sensor-based HAR, discuss several important applications that rely on HAR, and
highlight the most common machine learning methods that have been used for HAR.
Finally, several challenges of HAR are explored that should be addressed to
further improve the robustness of HAR.

    <title>Reducing Selection Bias in Counterfactual Reasoning for Individual
  Treatment Effects Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Counterfactual reasoning is an important paradigm applicable in many fields,
such as healthcare, economics, and education. In this work, we propose a novel
method to address the issue of \textit{selection bias}. We learn two groups of
latent random variables, where one group corresponds to variables that only
cause selection bias, and the other group is relevant for outcome prediction.
They are learned by an auto-encoder where an additional regularized loss based
on Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) encourages the de-correlation between
the two groups of random variables. This allows for explicitly alleviating
selection bias by only keeping the latent variables that are relevant for
estimating individual treatment effects. Experimental results on a synthetic
toy dataset and a benchmark dataset show that our algorithm is able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance and improve the result of its counterpart that
does not explicitly model the selection bias.

    <title>NAS-X: Neural Adaptive Smoothing via Twisting</title>
    <summary>  Sequential latent variable models (SLVMs) are essential tools in statistics
and machine learning, with applications ranging from healthcare to
neuroscience. As their flexibility increases, analytic inference and model
learning can become challenging, necessitating approximate methods. Here we
introduce neural adaptive smoothing via twisting (NAS-X), a method that extends
reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) to the sequential setting by using smoothing
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate intractable posterior expectations.
Combining RWS and smoothing SMC allows NAS-X to provide low-bias and
low-variance gradient estimates, and fit both discrete and continuous latent
variable models. We illustrate the theoretical advantages of NAS-X over
previous methods and explore these advantages empirically in a variety of
tasks, including a challenging application to mechanistic models of neuronal
dynamics. These experiments show that NAS-X substantially outperforms previous
VI- and RWS-based methods in inference and model learning, achieving lower
parameter error and tighter likelihood bounds.

    <title>Fast On-Device Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks via
  Online-Within-Online Meta-Learning</title>
    <summary>  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained popularity as machine
learning models for on-device edge intelligence for applications such as mobile
healthcare management and natural language processing due to their low power
profile. In such highly personalized use cases, it is important for the model
to be able to adapt to the unique features of an individual with only a minimal
amount of training data. Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to train
models that are geared towards quick adaptation to new tasks. The few existing
meta-learning solutions for SNNs operate offline and require some form of
backpropagation that is incompatible with the current neuromorphic
edge-devices. In this paper, we propose an online-within-online meta-learning
rule for SNNs termed OWOML-SNN, that enables lifelong learning on a stream of
tasks, and relies on local, backprop-free, nested updates.

    <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques for Windows Ransomware Network
  Traffic Detection</title>
    <summary>  Ransomware has become a significant global threat with the
ransomware-as-a-service model enabling easy availability and deployment, and
the potential for high revenues creating a viable criminal business model.
Individuals, private companies or public service providers e.g. healthcare or
utilities companies can all become victims of ransomware attacks and
consequently suffer severe disruption and financial loss. Although machine
learning algorithms are already being used to detect ransomware, variants are
being developed to specifically evade detection when using dynamic machine
learning techniques. In this paper, we introduce NetConverse, a machine
learning analysis of Windows ransomware network traffic to achieve a high,
consistent detection rate. Using a dataset created from conversation-based
network traffic features we achieved a true positive detection rate of 97.1%
using the Decision Tree (J48) classifier.

    <title>A Survey on the Explainability of Supervised Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Predictions obtained by, e.g., artificial neural networks have a high
accuracy but humans often perceive the models as black boxes. Insights about
the decision making are mostly opaque for humans. Particularly understanding
the decision making in highly sensitive areas such as healthcare or fifinance,
is of paramount importance. The decision-making behind the black boxes requires
it to be more transparent, accountable, and understandable for humans. This
survey paper provides essential definitions, an overview of the different
principles and methodologies of explainable Supervised Machine Learning (SML).
We conduct a state-of-the-art survey that reviews past and recent explainable
SML approaches and classifies them according to the introduced definitions.
Finally, we illustrate principles by means of an explanatory case study and
discuss important future directions.

    <title>survex: an R package for explaining machine learning survival models</title>
    <summary>  Due to their flexibility and superior performance, machine learning models
frequently complement and outperform traditional statistical survival models.
However, their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of user-friendly tools
to explain their internal operations and prediction rationales. To tackle this
issue, we introduce the survex R package, which provides a cohesive framework
for explaining any survival model by applying explainable artificial
intelligence techniques. The capabilities of the proposed software encompass
understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their
improvement. By revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as
variable effects and importances, survex enables the assessment of model
reliability and the detection of biases. Thus, transparency and responsibility
may be promoted in sensitive areas, such as biomedical research and healthcare
applications.

    <title>Can I trust my fake data -- A comprehensive quality assessment framework
  for synthetic tabular data in healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Ensuring safe adoption of AI tools in healthcare hinges on access to
sufficient data for training, testing and validation. In response to privacy
concerns and regulatory requirements, using synthetic data has been suggested.
Synthetic data is created by training a generator on real data to produce a
dataset with similar statistical properties. Competing metrics with differing
taxonomies for quality evaluation have been suggested, resulting in a complex
landscape. Optimising quality entails balancing considerations that make the
data fit for use, yet relevant dimensions are left out of existing frameworks.
We performed a comprehensive literature review on the use of quality evaluation
metrics on SD within the scope of tabular healthcare data and SD made using
deep generative methods. Based on this and the collective team experiences, we
developed a conceptual framework for quality assurance. The applicability was
benchmarked against a practical case from the Dutch National Cancer Registry.
We present a conceptual framework for quality assurance of SD for AI
applications in healthcare that aligns diverging taxonomies, expands on common
quality dimensions to include the dimensions of Fairness and Carbon footprint,
and proposes stages necessary to support real-life applications. Building trust
in synthetic data by increasing transparency and reducing the safety risk will
accelerate the development and uptake of trustworthy AI tools for the benefit
of patients. Despite the growing emphasis on algorithmic fairness and carbon
footprint, these metrics were scarce in the literature review. The overwhelming
focus was on statistical similarity using distance metrics while sequential
logic detection was scarce. A consensus-backed framework that includes all
relevant quality dimensions can provide assurance for safe and responsible
real-life applications of SD.

    <title>Secure Sum Outperforms Homomorphic Encryption in (Current) Collaborative
  Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) approaches are achieving extraordinary results in a wide
range of domains, but often require a massive collection of private data.
Hence, methods for training neural networks on the joint data of different data
owners, that keep each party's input confidential, are called for. We address a
specific setting in federated learning, namely that of deep learning from
horizontally distributed data with a limited number of parties, where their
vulnerable intermediate results have to be processed in a privacy-preserving
manner. This setting can be found in medical and healthcare as well as
industrial applications. The predominant scheme for this is based on
homomorphic encryption (HE), and it is widely considered to be without
alternative. In contrast to this, we demonstrate that a carefully chosen, less
complex and computationally less expensive secure sum protocol in conjunction
with default secure channels exhibits superior properties in terms of both
collusion-resistance and runtime. Finally, we discuss several open research
questions in the context of collaborative DL, especially regarding privacy
risks caused by joint intermediate results.

    <title>Vulnerability Due to Training Order in Split Learning</title>
    <summary>  Split learning (SL) is a privacy-preserving distributed deep learning method
used to train a collaborative model without the need for sharing of patient's
raw data between clients. In split learning, an additional privacy-preserving
algorithm called no-peek algorithm can be incorporated, which is robust to
adversarial attacks. The privacy benefits offered by split learning make it
suitable for practice in the healthcare domain. However, the split learning
algorithm is flawed as the collaborative model is trained sequentially, i.e.,
one client trains after the other. We point out that the model trained using
the split learning algorithm gets biased towards the data of the clients used
for training towards the end of a round. This makes SL algorithms highly
susceptible to the order in which clients are considered for training. We
demonstrate that the model trained using the data of all clients does not
perform well on the client's data which was considered earliest in a round for
training the model. Moreover, we show that this effect becomes more prominent
with the increase in the number of clients. We also demonstrate that the
SplitFedv3 algorithm mitigates this problem while still leveraging the privacy
benefits provided by split learning.

    <title>Offline Policy Evaluation and Optimization under Confounding</title>
    <summary>  Evaluating and optimizing policies in the presence of unobserved confounders
is a problem of growing interest in offline reinforcement learning. Using
conventional methods for offline RL in the presence of confounding can not only
lead to poor decisions and poor policies, but also have disastrous effects in
critical applications such as healthcare and education. We map out the
landscape of offline policy evaluation for confounded MDPs, distinguishing
assumptions on confounding based on whether they are memoryless and on their
effect on the data-collection policies. We characterize settings where
consistent value estimates are provably not achievable, and provide algorithms
with guarantees to instead estimate lower bounds on the value. When consistent
estimates are achievable, we provide algorithms for value estimation with
sample complexity guarantees. We also present new algorithms for offline policy
improvement and prove local convergence guarantees. Finally, we experimentally
evaluate our algorithms on both a gridworld environment and a simulated
healthcare setting of managing sepsis patients. In gridworld, our model-based
method provides tighter lower bounds than existing methods, while in the sepsis
simulator, our methods significantly outperform confounder-oblivious
benchmarks.

    <title>Gastrointestinal Disease Classification through Explainable and
  Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Networks with Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
    <summary>  Gastrointestinal diseases pose significant healthcare chall-enges as they
manifest in diverse ways and can lead to potential complications. Ensuring
precise and timely classification of these diseases is pivotal in guiding
treatment choices and enhancing patient outcomes. This paper introduces a novel
approach on classifying gastrointestinal diseases by leveraging cost-sensitive
pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with
supervised contrastive learning. Our approach enables the network to learn
representations that capture vital disease-related features, while also
considering the relationships of similarity between samples. To tackle the
challenges posed by imbalanced datasets and the cost-sensitive nature of
misclassification errors in healthcare, we incorporate cost-sensitive learning.
By assigning distinct costs to misclassifications based on the disease class,
we prioritize accurate classification of critical conditions. Furthermore, we
enhance the interpretability of our model by integrating gradient-based
techniques from explainable artificial intelligence (AI). This inclusion
provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of the network,
aiding in understanding the features that contribute to disease classification.
To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we perform extensive
experiments on a comprehensive gastrointestinal disease dataset, such as the
Hyper-Kvasir dataset. Through thorough comparisons with existing works, we
demonstrate the strong classification accuracy, robustness and interpretability
of our model. We have made the implementation of our proposed approach publicly
available at

    <title>Personalized Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease Detection: A Case Study of
  President Reagan's Speeches</title>
    <summary>  Alzheimer`s disease (AD)-related global healthcare cost is estimated to be $1
trillion by 2050. Currently, there is no cure for this disease; however,
clinical studies show that early diagnosis and intervention helps to extend the
quality of life and inform technologies for personalized mental healthcare.
Clinical research indicates that the onset and progression of Alzheimer`s
disease lead to dementia and other mental health issues. As a result, the
language capabilities of patient start to decline. In this paper, we show that
machine learning-based unsupervised clustering of and anomaly detection with
linguistic biomarkers are promising approaches for intuitive visualization and
personalized early stage detection of Alzheimer`s disease. We demonstrate this
approach on 10 year`s (1980 to 1989) of President Ronald Reagan`s speech data
set. Key linguistic biomarkers that indicate early-stage AD are identified.
Experimental results show that Reagan had early onset of Alzheimer`s sometime
between 1983 and 1987. This finding is corroborated by prior work that analyzed
his interviews using a statistical technique. The proposed technique also
identifies the exact speeches that reflect linguistic biomarkers for early
stage AD.

    <title>Conditional Generation of Medical Time Series for Extrapolation to
  Underrepresented Populations</title>
    <summary>  The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and subsequent
increased availability of longitudinal healthcare data has led to significant
advances in our understanding of health and disease with direct and immediate
impact on the development of new diagnostics and therapeutic treatment options.
However, access to EHRs is often restricted due to their perceived sensitive
nature and associated legal concerns, and the cohorts therein typically are
those seen at a specific hospital or network of hospitals and therefore not
representative of the wider population of patients. Here, we present HealthGen,
a new approach for the conditional generation of synthetic EHRs that maintains
an accurate representation of real patient characteristics, temporal
information and missingness patterns. We demonstrate experimentally that
HealthGen generates synthetic cohorts that are significantly more faithful to
real patient EHRs than the current state-of-the-art, and that augmenting real
data sets with conditionally generated cohorts of underrepresented
subpopulations of patients can significantly enhance the generalisability of
models derived from these data sets to different patient populations. Synthetic
conditionally generated EHRs could help increase the accessibility of
longitudinal healthcare data sets and improve the generalisability of
inferences made from these data sets to underrepresented populations.

    <title>Designing Equitable Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Predictive algorithms are now used to help distribute a large share of our
society's resources and sanctions, such as healthcare, loans, criminal
detentions, and tax audits. Under the right circumstances, these algorithms can
improve the efficiency and equity of decision-making. At the same time, there
is a danger that the algorithms themselves could entrench and exacerbate
disparities, particularly along racial, ethnic, and gender lines. To help
ensure their fairness, many researchers suggest that algorithms be subject to
at least one of three constraints: (1) no use of legally protected features,
such as race, ethnicity, and gender; (2) equal rates of "positive" decisions
across groups; and (3) equal error rates across groups. Here we show that these
constraints, while intuitively appealing, often worsen outcomes for individuals
in marginalized groups, and can even leave all groups worse off. The inherent
trade-off we identify between formal fairness constraints and welfare
improvements -- particularly for the marginalized -- highlights the need for a
more robust discussion on what it means for an algorithm to be "fair". We
illustrate these ideas with examples from healthcare and the criminal-legal
system, and make several proposals to help practitioners design more equitable
algorithms.

    <title>Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Ready for Practical Applications in
  Healthcare? A Sensitivity Analysis of Duel-DDQN for Hemodynamic Management in
  Sepsis Patients</title>
    <summary>  The potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been demonstrated through
successful applications to games such as Go and Atari. However, while it is
straightforward to evaluate the performance of an RL algorithm in a game
setting by simply using it to play the game, evaluation is a major challenge in
clinical settings where it could be unsafe to follow RL policies in practice.
Thus, understanding sensitivity of RL policies to the host of decisions made
during implementation is an important step toward building the type of trust in
RL required for eventual clinical uptake. In this work, we perform a
sensitivity analysis on a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (Dueling Double Deep
Q-Networks)applied to hemodynamic stabilization treatment strategies for septic
patients in the ICU. We consider sensitivity of learned policies to input
features, embedding model architecture, time discretization, reward function,
and random seeds. We find that varying these settings can significantly impact
learned policies, which suggests a need for caution when interpreting RL agent
output.

    <title>Enhancing the Interpretability of Deep Models in Heathcare Through
  Attention: Application to Glucose Forecasting for Diabetic People</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of deep learning in healthcare is hindered by their "black box"
nature. In this paper, we explore the RETAIN architecture for the task of
glusose forecasting for diabetic people. By using a two-level attention
mechanism, the recurrent-neural-network-based RETAIN model is interpretable. We
evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets
by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models
and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers
a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as
accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the
usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each
variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than one
hour are not used by the RETAIN model for the 30-minutes ahead of time
prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior
upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions.
In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is
particularily important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to
its interpretability, seems to be a very promissing model for regression or
classification tasks in healthcare.

    <title>Multi-task Causal Learning with Gaussian Processes</title>
    <summary>  This paper studies the problem of learning the correlation structure of a set
of intervention functions defined on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of a
causal model. This is useful when we are interested in jointly learning the
causal effects of interventions on different subsets of variables in a DAG,
which is common in field such as healthcare or operations research. We propose
the first multi-task causal Gaussian process (GP) model, which we call DAG-GP,
that allows for information sharing across continuous interventions and across
experiments on different variables. DAG-GP accommodates different assumptions
in terms of data availability and captures the correlation between functions
lying in input spaces of different dimensionality via a well-defined integral
operator. We give theoretical results detailing when and how the DAG-GP model
can be formulated depending on the DAG. We test both the quality of its
predictions and its calibrated uncertainties. Compared to single-task models,
DAG-GP achieves the best fitting performance in a variety of real and synthetic
settings. In addition, it helps to select optimal interventions faster than
competing approaches when used within sequential decision making frameworks,
like active learning or Bayesian optimization.

    <title>Improved Algorithms for Conservative Exploration in Bandits</title>
    <summary>  In many fields such as digital marketing, healthcare, finance, and robotics,
it is common to have a well-tested and reliable baseline policy running in
production (e.g., a recommender system). Nonetheless, the baseline policy is
often suboptimal. In this case, it is desirable to deploy online learning
algorithms (e.g., a multi-armed bandit algorithm) that interact with the system
to learn a better/optimal policy under the constraint that during the learning
process the performance is almost never worse than the performance of the
baseline itself. In this paper, we study the conservative learning problem in
the contextual linear bandit setting and introduce a novel algorithm, the
Conservative Constrained LinUCB (CLUCB2). We derive regret bounds for CLUCB2
that match existing results and empirically show that it outperforms
state-of-the-art conservative bandit algorithms in a number of synthetic and
real-world problems. Finally, we consider a more realistic constraint where the
performance is verified only at predefined checkpoints (instead of at every
step) and show how this relaxed constraint favorably impacts the regret and
empirical performance of CLUCB2.

    <title>Towards Developing Safety Assurance Cases for Learning-Enabled Medical
  Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) technologies have been increasingly adopted in Medical
Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) to enable smart healthcare. Assuring the safety
and effectiveness of learning-enabled MCPS is challenging, as such systems must
account for diverse patient profiles and physiological dynamics and handle
operational uncertainties. In this paper, we develop a safety assurance case
for ML controllers in learning-enabled MCPS, with an emphasis on establishing
confidence in the ML-based predictions. We present the safety assurance case in
detail for Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) as a representative application of
learning-enabled MCPS, and provide a detailed analysis by implementing a deep
neural network for the prediction in APS. We check the sufficiency of the ML
data and analyze the correctness of the ML-based prediction using formal
verification. Finally, we outline open research problems based on our
experience in this paper.

    <title>Foundations and Trends in Multimodal Machine Learning: Principles,
  Challenges, and Open Questions</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal machine learning is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field
that aims to design computer agents with intelligent capabilities such as
understanding, reasoning, and learning through integrating multiple
communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic, visual, tactile, and
physiological messages. With the recent interest in video understanding,
embodied autonomous agents, text-to-image generation, and multisensor fusion in
application domains such as healthcare and robotics, multimodal machine
learning has brought unique computational and theoretical challenges to the
machine learning community given the heterogeneity of data sources and the
interconnections often found between modalities. However, the breadth of
progress in multimodal research has made it difficult to identify the common
themes and open questions in the field. By synthesizing a broad range of
application domains and theoretical frameworks from both historical and recent
perspectives, this paper is designed to provide an overview of the
computational and theoretical foundations of multimodal machine learning. We
start by defining three key principles of modality heterogeneity, connections,
and interactions that have driven subsequent innovations, and propose a
taxonomy of six core technical challenges: representation, alignment,
reasoning, generation, transference, and quantification covering historical and
recent trends. Recent technical achievements will be presented through the lens
of this taxonomy, allowing researchers to understand the similarities and
differences across new approaches. We end by motivating several open problems
for future research as identified by our taxonomy.

    <title>COVID-19 detection from scarce chest x-ray image data using few-shot
  deep learning approach</title>
    <summary>  In the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, there is an urgent need to screen
infected patients quickly and accurately. Using deep learning models trained on
chest X-ray images can become an efficient method for screening COVID-19
patients in these situations. Deep learning approaches are already widely used
in the medical community. However, they require a large amount of data to be
accurate. The open-source community collectively has made efforts to collect
and annotate the data, but it is not enough to train an accurate deep learning
model. Few-shot learning is a sub-field of machine learning that aims to learn
the objective with less amount of data. In this work, we have experimented with
well-known solutions for data scarcity in deep learning to detect COVID-19.
These include data augmentation, transfer learning, and few-shot learning, and
unsupervised learning. We have also proposed a custom few-shot learning
approach to detect COVID-19 using siamese networks. Our experimental results
showcased that we can implement an efficient and accurate deep learning model
for COVID-19 detection by adopting the few-shot learning approaches even with
less amount of data. Using our proposed approach we were able to achieve 96.4%
accuracy an improvement from 83% using baseline models.

    <title>Data Analytics in Operations Management: A Review</title>
    <summary>  Research in operations management has traditionally focused on models for
understanding, mostly at a strategic level, how firms should operate. Spurred
by the growing availability of data and recent advances in machine learning and
optimization methodologies, there has been an increasing application of data
analytics to problems in operations management. In this paper, we review recent
applications of data analytics to operations management, in three major areas
-- supply chain management, revenue management and healthcare operations -- and
highlight some exciting directions for the future.

    <title>When Eye-Tracking Meets Machine Learning: A Systematic Review on
  Applications in Medical Image Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Eye-gaze tracking research offers significant promise in enhancing various
healthcare-related tasks, above all in medical image analysis and
interpretation. Eye tracking, a technology that monitors and records the
movement of the eyes, provides valuable insights into human visual attention
patterns. This technology can transform how healthcare professionals and
medical specialists engage with and analyze diagnostic images, offering a more
insightful and efficient approach to medical diagnostics. Hence, extracting
meaningful features and insights from medical images by leveraging eye-gaze
data improves our understanding of how radiologists and other medical experts
monitor, interpret, and understand images for diagnostic purposes. Eye-tracking
data, with intricate human visual attention patterns embedded, provides a
bridge to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) development and human
cognition. This integration allows novel methods to incorporate domain
knowledge into machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to
enhance their alignment with human-like perception and decision-making.
Moreover, extensive collections of eye-tracking data have also enabled novel
ML/DL methods to analyze human visual patterns, paving the way to a better
understanding of human vision, attention, and cognition. This systematic review
investigates eye-gaze tracking applications and methodologies for enhancing
ML/DL algorithms for medical image analysis in depth.

    <title>ZTCloudGuard: Zero Trust Context-Aware Access Management Framework to
  Avoid Misuse Cases in the Era of Generative AI and Cloud-based Health
  Information Ecosystem</title>
    <summary>  Managing access between large numbers of distributed medical devices has
become a crucial aspect of modern healthcare systems, enabling the
establishment of smart hospitals and telehealth infrastructure. However, as
telehealth technology continues to evolve and Internet of Things (IoT) devices
become more widely used, they are also becoming increasingly exposed to various
types of vulnerabilities and medical errors. In healthcare information systems,
about 90\% of vulnerabilities emerged from misuse cases and human errors. As a
result, there is a need for additional research and development of security
tools to prevent such attacks. This article proposes a zero-trust-based
context-aware framework for managing access to the main components of the cloud
ecosystem, including users, devices and output data. The main goal and benefit
of the proposed framework is to build a scoring system to prevent or alleviate
misuse cases while using distributed medical devices in cloud-based healthcare
information systems. The framework has two main scoring schemas to maintain the
chain of trust. First, it proposes a critical trust score based on cloud-native
micro-services of authentication, encryption, logging, and authorizations.
Second, creating a bond trust scoring to assess the real-time semantic and
syntactic analysis of attributes stored in a healthcare information system. The
analysis is based on a pre-trained machine learning model to generate the
semantic and syntactic scores. The framework also takes into account regulatory
compliance and user consent to create a scoring system. The advantage of this
method is that it is applicable to any language and adapts to all attributes as
it relies on a language model, not just a set of predefined and limited
attributes. The results show a high F1 score of 93.5%, which proves that it is
valid for detecting misuse cases.

    <title>EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies
  on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and
  their Applications</title>
    <summary>  Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users
and systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating
and interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and
computer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,
thereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational
neuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable
sensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning
approaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI
for translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from
EEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in
cognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this
study, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and
computational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the
gaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,
we first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,
we present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and
clean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art
computational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,
transfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or
track human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent
applications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired
healthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in
EEG-based BCIs.

    <title>Understanding Missingness in Time-series Electronic Health Records for
  Individualized Representation</title>
    <summary>  With the widespread of machine learning models for healthcare applications,
there is increased interest in building applications for personalized medicine.
Despite the plethora of proposed research for personalized medicine, very few
focus on representing missingness and learning from the missingness patterns in
time-series Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. The lack of focus on
missingness representation in an individualized way limits the full utilization
of machine learning applications towards true personalization. In this brief
communication, we highlight new insights into patterns of missingness with
real-world examples and implications of missingness in EHRs. The insights in
this work aim to bridge the gap between theoretical assumptions and practical
observations in real-world EHRs. We hope this work will open new doors for
exploring directions for better representation in predictive modelling for true
personalization.

    <title>A Deep Learning based Wearable Healthcare IoT Device for AI-enabled
  Hearing Assistance Automation</title>
    <summary>  With the recent booming of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep
learning techniques, digital healthcare is one of the prevalent areas that
could gain benefits from AI-enabled functionality. This research presents a
novel AI-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) device operating from the ESP-8266
platform capable of assisting those who suffer from impairment of hearing or
deafness to communicate with others in conversations. In the proposed solution,
a server application is created that leverages Google's online speech
recognition service to convert the received conversations into texts, then
deployed to a micro-display attached to the glasses to display the conversation
contents to deaf people, to enable and assist conversation as normal with the
general population. Furthermore, in order to raise alert of traffic or
dangerous scenarios, an 'urban-emergency' classifier is developed using a deep
learning model, Inception-v4, with transfer learning to detect/recognize
alerting/alarming sounds, such as a horn sound or a fire alarm, with texts
generated to alert the prospective user. The training of Inception-v4 was
carried out on a consumer desktop PC and then implemented into the AI based IoT
application. The empirical results indicate that the developed prototype system
achieves an accuracy rate of 92% for sound recognition and classification with
real-time performance.

    <title>Assessing mortality prediction through different representation models
  based on concepts extracted from clinical notes</title>
    <summary>  Recent years have seen particular interest in using electronic medical
records (EMRs) for secondary purposes to enhance the quality and safety of
healthcare delivery. EMRs tend to contain large amounts of valuable clinical
notes. Learning of embedding is a method for converting notes into a format
that makes them comparable. Transformer-based representation models have
recently made a great leap forward. These models are pre-trained on large
online datasets to understand natural language texts effectively. The quality
of a learning embedding is influenced by how clinical notes are used as input
to representation models. A clinical note has several sections with different
levels of information value. It is also common for healthcare providers to use
different expressions for the same concept. Existing methods use clinical notes
directly or with an initial preprocessing as input to representation models.
However, to learn a good embedding, we identified the most essential clinical
notes section. We then mapped the extracted concepts from selected sections to
the standard names in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We used the
standard phrases corresponding to the unique concepts as input for clinical
models. We performed experiments to measure the usefulness of the learned
embedding vectors in the task of hospital mortality prediction on a subset of
the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)
dataset. According to the experiments, clinical transformer-based
representation models produced better results with getting input generated by
standard names of extracted unique concepts compared to other input formats.
The best-performing models were BioBERT, PubMedBERT, and UmlsBERT,
respectively.

    <title>Transfer Learning Across Patient Variations with Hidden Parameter Markov
  Decision Processes</title>
    <summary>  Due to physiological variation, patients diagnosed with the same condition
may exhibit divergent, but related, responses to the same treatments. Hidden
Parameter Markov Decision Processes (HiP-MDPs) tackle this transfer-learning
problem by embedding these tasks into a low-dimensional space. However, the
original formulation of HiP-MDP had a critical flaw: the embedding uncertainty
was modeled independently of the agent's state uncertainty, requiring an
unnatural training procedure in which all tasks visited every part of the state
space---possible for robots that can be moved to a particular location,
impossible for human patients. We update the HiP-MDP framework and extend it to
more robustly develop personalized medicine strategies for HIV treatment.

    <title>Patient Contrastive Learning: a Performant, Expressive, and Practical
  Approach to ECG Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Supervised machine learning applications in health care are often limited due
to a scarcity of labeled training data. To mitigate this effect of small sample
size, we introduce a pre-training approach, Patient Contrastive Learning of
Representations (PCLR), which creates latent representations of ECGs from a
large number of unlabeled examples. The resulting representations are
expressive, performant, and practical across a wide spectrum of clinical tasks.
We develop PCLR using a large health care system with over 3.2 million 12-lead
ECGs, and demonstrate substantial improvements across multiple new tasks when
there are fewer than 5,000 labels. We release our model to extract ECG
representations at
https://github.com/broadinstitute/ml4h/tree/master/model_zoo/PCLR.

    <title>SparGE: Sparse Coding-based Patient Similarity Learning via Low-rank
  Constraints and Graph Embedding</title>
    <summary>  Patient similarity assessment (PSA) is pivotal to evidence-based and
personalized medicine, enabled by analyzing the increasingly available
electronic health records (EHRs). However, machine learning approaches for PSA
has to deal with inherent data deficiencies of EHRs, namely missing values,
noise, and small sample sizes. In this work, an end-to-end discriminative
learning framework, called SparGE, is proposed to address these data challenges
of EHR for PSA. SparGE measures similarity by jointly sparse coding and graph
embedding. First, we use low-rank constrained sparse coding to identify and
calculate weight for similar patients, while denoising against missing values.
Then, graph embedding on sparse representations is adopted to measure the
similarity between patient pairs via preserving local relationships defined by
distances. Finally, a global cost function is constructed to optimize related
parameters. Experimental results on two private and public real-world
healthcare datasets, namely SingHEART and MIMIC-III, show that the proposed
SparGE significantly outperforms other machine learning patient similarity
methods.

    <title>Deep Representation for Patient Visits from Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  We show how to learn low-dimensional representations (embeddings) of patient
visits from the corresponding electronic health record (EHR) where
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes are removed. We
expect that these embeddings will be useful for the construction of predictive
statistical models anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve
healthcare quality. These embeddings are learned using a deep neural network
trained to predict ICD diagnosis categories. We show that our embeddings
capture relevant clinical informations and can be used directly as input to
standard machine learning algorithms like multi-output classifiers for ICD code
prediction. We also show that important medical informations correspond to
particular directions in our embedding space.

    <title>Healthcare Cost Prediction: Leveraging Fine-grain Temporal Patterns</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To design and assess a method to leverage individuals' temporal
data for predicting their healthcare cost. To achieve this goal, we first used
patients' temporal data in their fine-grain form as opposed to coarse-grain
form. Second, we devised novel spike detection features to extract temporal
patterns that improve the performance of cost prediction. Third, we evaluated
the effectiveness of different types of temporal features based on cost
information, visit information and medical information for the prediction task.
  Materials and methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims
data from 2013 to 2016 from a healthcare insurer, where the first two years
were used to build the model to predict the costs in the third year. To prepare
the data for modeling and prediction, the time series data of cost, visit and
medical information were extracted in the form of fine-grain features (i.e.,
segmenting each time series into a sequence of consecutive windows and
representing each window by various statistics such as sum). Then, temporal
patterns of the time series were extracted and added to fine-grain features
using a novel set of spike detection features (i.e., the fluctuation of data
points). Gradient Boosting was applied on the final set of extracted features.
Moreover, the contribution of each type of data (i.e., cost, visit and medical)
was assessed.
  Conclusions: Leveraging fine-grain temporal patterns for healthcare cost
prediction significantly improves prediction performance. Enhancing fine-grain
features with extraction of temporal cost and visit patterns significantly
improved the performance. However, medical features did not have a significant
effect on prediction performance. Gradient Boosting outperformed all other
prediction models.

    <title>DeepCare: A Deep Dynamic Memory Model for Predictive Medicine</title>
    <summary>  Personalized predictive medicine necessitates the modeling of patient illness
and care processes, which inherently have long-term temporal dependencies.
Healthcare observations, recorded in electronic medical records, are episodic
and irregular in time. We introduce DeepCare, an end-to-end deep dynamic neural
network that reads medical records, stores previous illness history, infers
current illness states and predicts future medical outcomes. At the data level,
DeepCare represents care episodes as vectors in space, models patient health
state trajectories through explicit memory of historical records. Built on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), DeepCare introduces time parameterizations to handle
irregular timed events by moderating the forgetting and consolidation of memory
cells. DeepCare also incorporates medical interventions that change the course
of illness and shape future medical risk. Moving up to the health state level,
historical and present health states are then aggregated through multiscale
temporal pooling, before passing through a neural network that estimates future
outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of DeepCare for disease progression
modeling, intervention recommendation, and future risk prediction. On two
important cohorts with heavy social and economic burden -- diabetes and mental
health -- the results show improved modeling and risk prediction accuracy.

    <title>Limited Resource Allocation in a Non-Markovian World: The Case of
  Maternal and Child Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The success of many healthcare programs depends on participants' adherence.
We consider the problem of scheduling interventions in low resource settings
(e.g., placing timely support calls from health workers) to increase adherence
and/or engagement. Past works have successfully developed several classes of
Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) based solutions for this problem.
Nevertheless, all past RMAB approaches assume that the participants' behaviour
follows the Markov property. We demonstrate significant deviations from the
Markov assumption on real-world data on a maternal health awareness program
from our partner NGO, ARMMAN. Moreover, we extend RMABs to continuous state
spaces, a previously understudied area. To tackle the generalised non-Markovian
RMAB setting we (i) model each participant's trajectory as a time-series, (ii)
leverage the power of time-series forecasting models to learn complex patterns
and dynamics to predict future states, and (iii) propose the Time-series Arm
Ranking Index (TARI) policy, a novel algorithm that selects the RMAB arms that
will benefit the most from an intervention, given our future state predictions.
We evaluate our approach on both synthetic data, and a secondary analysis on
real data from ARMMAN, and demonstrate significant increase in engagement
compared to the SOTA, deployed Whittle index solution. This translates to 16.3
hours of additional content listened, 90.8% more engagement drops prevented,
and reaching more than twice as many high dropout-risk beneficiaries.

    <title>Towards Interpretable Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) enables multiple data owners to build machine
learning models collaboratively without exposing their private local data. In
order for FL to achieve widespread adoption, it is important to balance the
need for performance, privacy-preservation and interpretability, especially in
mission critical applications such as finance and healthcare. Thus,
interpretable federated learning (IFL) has become an emerging topic of research
attracting significant interest from the academia and the industry alike. Its
interdisciplinary nature can be challenging for new researchers to pick up. In
this paper, we bridge this gap by providing (to the best of our knowledge) the
first survey on IFL. We propose a unique IFL taxonomy which covers relevant
works enabling FL models to explain the prediction results, support model
debugging, and provide insights into the contributions made by individual data
owners or data samples, which in turn, is crucial for allocating rewards fairly
to motivate active and reliable participation in FL. We conduct comprehensive
analysis of the representative IFL approaches, the commonly adopted performance
evaluation metrics, and promising directions towards building versatile IFL
techniques.

    <title>Sparse Deep Learning for Time Series Data: Theory and Applications</title>
    <summary>  Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the
performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates
and prediction uncertainty quantification are of concern.

    <title>Research Report -- Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning Lab</title>
    <summary>  Robots capable of performing manipulation tasks in a broad range of missions
in unstructured environments can develop numerous applications to impact and
enhance human life. Existing work in robot learning has shown success in
applying conventional machine learning algorithms to enable robots for
replicating rather simple manipulation tasks in manufacturing, service and
healthcare applications, among others. However, learning robust and versatile
models for complex manipulation tasks that are inherently multi-faceted and
naturally intricate demands algorithmic advancements in robot learning. Our
research supports the long-term goal of making robots more accessible and
serviceable to the general public by expanding robot applications to real-world
scenarios that require systems capable of performing complex tasks. To achieve
this goal, we focus on identifying and investigating knowledge gaps in robot
learning of complex manipulation tasks by leveraging upon human-robot
interaction and robot learning from human instructions. This document presents
an overview of the recent research developments in the Persistent Autonomy and
Robot Learning (PeARL) lab at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Here, I
briefly discuss different research directions, and present a few proposed
approaches in our most recent publications. For each proposed approach, I then
mention potential future directions that can advance the field.

    <title>Counterfactual Off-Policy Evaluation with Gumbel-Max Structural Causal
  Models</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an off-policy evaluation procedure for highlighting episodes
where applying a reinforcement learned (RL) policy is likely to have produced a
substantially different outcome than the observed policy. In particular, we
introduce a class of structural causal models (SCMs) for generating
counterfactual trajectories in finite partially observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDPs). We see this as a useful procedure for off-policy
"debugging" in high-risk settings (e.g., healthcare); by decomposing the
expected difference in reward between the RL and observed policy into specific
episodes, we can identify episodes where the counterfactual difference in
reward is most dramatic. This in turn can be used to facilitate review of
specific episodes by domain experts. We demonstrate the utility of this
procedure with a synthetic environment of sepsis management.

    <title>The Ability of Image-Language Explainable Models to Resemble Domain
  Expertise</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in vision and language (V+L) models have a promising impact
in the healthcare field. However, such models struggle to explain how and why a
particular decision was made. In addition, model transparency and involvement
of domain expertise are critical success factors for machine learning models to
make an entrance into the field. In this work, we study the use of the local
surrogate explainability technique to overcome the problem of black-box deep
learning models. We explore the feasibility of resembling domain expertise
using the local surrogates in combination with an underlying V+L to generate
multi-modal visual and language explanations. We demonstrate that such
explanations can serve as helpful feedback in guiding model training for data
scientists and machine learning engineers in the field.

    <title>Poisoning the Search Space in Neural Architecture Search</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective problem-solving tool for
object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.

    <title>Clinician-in-the-Loop Decision Making: Reinforcement Learning with
  Near-Optimal Set-Valued Policies</title>
    <summary>  Standard reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy that
identifies the best action for each state. However, in healthcare settings,
many actions may be near-equivalent with respect to the reward (e.g.,
survival). We consider an alternative objective -- learning set-valued policies
to capture near-equivalent actions that lead to similar cumulative rewards. We
propose a model-free algorithm based on temporal difference learning and a
near-greedy heuristic for action selection. We analyze the theoretical
properties of the proposed algorithm, providing optimality guarantees and
demonstrate our approach on simulated environments and a real clinical task.
Empirically, the proposed algorithm exhibits good convergence properties and
discovers meaningful near-equivalent actions. Our work provides theoretical, as
well as practical, foundations for clinician/human-in-the-loop decision making,
in which humans (e.g., clinicians, patients) can incorporate additional
knowledge (e.g., side effects, patient preference) when selecting among
near-equivalent actions.

    <title>Distribution-Free Federated Learning with Conformal Predictions</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning has attracted considerable interest for collaborative
machine learning in healthcare to leverage separate institutional datasets
while maintaining patient privacy. However, additional challenges such as poor
calibration and lack of interpretability may also hamper widespread deployment
of federated models into clinical practice, leading to user distrust or misuse
of ML tools in high-stakes clinical decision-making. In this paper, we propose
to address these challenges by incorporating an adaptive conformal framework
into federated learning to ensure distribution-free prediction sets that
provide coverage guarantees. Importantly, these uncertainty estimates can be
obtained without requiring any additional modifications to the model. Empirical
results on the MedMNIST medical imaging benchmark demonstrate our federated
method provides tighter coverage over local conformal predictions on 6
different medical imaging datasets for 2D and 3D multi-class classification
tasks. Furthermore, we correlate class entropy with prediction set size to
assess task uncertainty.

    <title>Continual learning of longitudinal health records</title>
    <summary>  Continual learning denotes machine learning methods which can adapt to new
environments while retaining and reusing knowledge gained from past
experiences. Such methods address two issues encountered by models in
non-stationary environments: ungeneralisability to new data, and the
catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge when retrained. This is a
pervasive problem in clinical settings where patient data exhibits covariate
shift not only between populations, but also continuously over time. However,
while continual learning methods have seen nascent success in the imaging
domain, they have been little applied to the multi-variate sequential data
characteristic of critical care patient recordings.
  Here we evaluate a variety of continual learning methods on longitudinal ICU
data in a series of representative healthcare scenarios. We find that while
several methods mitigate short-term forgetting, domain shift remains a
challenging problem over large series of tasks, with only replay based methods
achieving stable long-term performance.

    <title>Causal Entropy Optimization</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of globally optimizing the causal effect on a target
variable of an unknown causal graph in which interventions can be performed.
This problem arises in many areas of science including biology, operations
research and healthcare. We propose Causal Entropy Optimization (CEO), a
framework that generalizes Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) to account for
all sources of uncertainty, including the one arising from the causal graph
structure. CEO incorporates the causal structure uncertainty both in the
surrogate models for the causal effects and in the mechanism used to select
interventions via an information-theoretic acquisition function. The resulting
algorithm automatically trades-off structure learning and causal effect
optimization, while naturally accounting for observation noise. For various
synthetic and real-world structural causal models, CEO achieves faster
convergence to the global optimum compared with CBO while also learning the
graph. Furthermore, our joint approach to structure learning and causal
optimization improves upon sequential, structure-learning-first approaches.

    <title>Heterogeneity Loss to Handle Intersubject and Intrasubject Variability
  in Cancer</title>
    <summary>  Developing nations lack adequate number of hospitals with modern equipment
and skilled doctors. Hence, a significant proportion of these nations'
population, particularly in rural areas, is not able to avail specialized and
timely healthcare facilities. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models, a
class of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, have shown impressive results in
medical domain. These AI methods can provide immense support to developing
nations as affordable healthcare solutions. This work is focused on one such
application of blood cancer diagnosis. However, there are some challenges to DL
models in cancer research because of the unavailability of a large data for
adequate training and the difficulty of capturing heterogeneity in data at
different levels ranging from acquisition characteristics, session, to
subject-level (within subjects and across subjects). These challenges render DL
models prone to overfitting and hence, models lack generalization on
prospective subjects' data. In this work, we address these problems in the
application of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) diagnosis using deep
learning. We propose heterogeneity loss that captures subject-level
heterogeneity, thereby, forcing the neural network to learn subject-independent
features. We also propose an unorthodox ensemble strategy that helps us in
providing improved classification over models trained on 7-folds giving a
weighted-$F_1$ score of 95.26% on unseen (test) subjects' data that are, so
far, the best results on the C-NMC 2019 dataset for B-ALL classification.

    <title>Sequence embeddings help to identify fraudulent cases in healthcare
  insurance</title>
    <summary>  Fraud causes substantial costs and losses for companies and clients in the
finance and insurance industries. Examples are fraudulent credit card
transactions or fraudulent claims. It has been estimated that roughly $10$
percent of the insurance industry's incurred losses and loss adjustment
expenses each year stem from fraudulent claims. The rise and proliferation of
digitization in finance and insurance have lead to big data sets, consisting in
particular of text data, which can be used for fraud detection. In this paper,
we propose architectures for text embeddings via deep learning, which help to
improve the detection of fraudulent claims compared to other machine learning
methods. We illustrate our methods using a data set from a large international
health insurance company. The empirical results show that our approach
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and can help make the claims
management process more efficient. As (unstructured) text data become
increasingly available to economists and econometricians, our proposed methods
will be valuable for many similar applications, particularly when variables
have a large number of categories as is typical for example of the
International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes in health economics and
health services.

    <title>FairEHR-CLP: Towards Fairness-Aware Clinical Predictions with
  Contrastive Learning in Multimodal Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  In the high-stakes realm of healthcare, ensuring fairness in predictive
models is crucial. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become integral to
medical decision-making, yet existing methods for enhancing model fairness
restrict themselves to unimodal data and fail to address the multifaceted
social biases intertwined with demographic factors in EHRs. To mitigate these
biases, we present FairEHR-CLP: a general framework for Fairness-aware Clinical
Predictions with Contrastive Learning in EHRs. FairEHR-CLP operates through a
two-stage process, utilizing patient demographics, longitudinal data, and
clinical notes. First, synthetic counterparts are generated for each patient,
allowing for diverse demographic identities while preserving essential health
information. Second, fairness-aware predictions employ contrastive learning to
align patient representations across sensitive attributes, jointly optimized
with an MLP classifier with a softmax layer for clinical classification tasks.
Acknowledging the unique challenges in EHRs, such as varying group sizes and
class imbalance, we introduce a novel fairness metric to effectively measure
error rate disparities across subgroups. Extensive experiments on three diverse
EHR datasets on three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FairEHR-CLP in
terms of fairness and utility compared with competitive baselines. FairEHR-CLP
represents an advancement towards ensuring both accuracy and equity in
predictive healthcare models.

transportation and finance. However, recently a preprint saved on Arxiv claim

lacking a strong ground. In this paper, we answer in detail the main issues and
misunderstandings raised by the authors of the preprint, and propose directions
to further expand the fields of application of early classification of time

    <title>Federated pretraining and fine tuning of BERT using clinical notes from
  multiple silos</title>
    <summary>  Large scale contextual representation models, such as BERT, have
significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) in recently years.
However, in certain area like healthcare, accessing diverse large scale text
data from multiple institutions is extremely challenging due to privacy and
regulatory reasons. In this article, we show that it is possible to both
pretrain and fine tune BERT models in a federated manner using clinical texts
from different silos without moving the data.

    <title>Exploring DNN Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks Using Approximate
  Multipliers</title>
    <summary>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have advanced in many real-world applications,
such as healthcare and autonomous driving. However, their high computational
complexity and vulnerability to adversarial attacks are ongoing challenges. In
this letter, approximate multipliers are used to explore DNN robustness
improvement against adversarial attacks. By uniformly replacing accurate
multipliers for state-of-the-art approximate ones in DNN layer models, we
explore the DNNs robustness against various adversarial attacks in a feasible
time. Results show up to 7% accuracy drop due to approximations when no attack
is present while improving robust accuracy up to 10% when attacks applied.

    <title>Quantum-inspired anomaly detection, a QUBO formulation</title>
    <summary>  Anomaly detection is a crucial task in machine learning that involves
identifying unusual patterns or events in data. It has numerous applications in
various domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. With the advent
of quantum computing, there has been a growing interest in developing quantum
approaches to anomaly detection. After reviewing traditional approaches to
anomaly detection relying on statistical or distance-based methods, we will
propose a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model formulation
of anomaly detection, compare it with classical methods, and discuss its
scalability on current Quantum Processing Units (QPU).

    <title>A Data-Efficient Deep Learning Based Smartphone Application For
  Detection Of Pulmonary Diseases Using Chest X-rays</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces a paradigm of smartphone application based disease
diagnostics that may completely revolutionise the way healthcare services are
being provided. Although primarily aimed to assist the problems in rendering
the healthcare services during the coronavirus pandemic, the model can also be
extended to identify the exact disease that the patient is caught with from a
broad spectrum of pulmonary diseases. The app inputs Chest X-Ray images
captured from the mobile camera which is then relayed to the AI architecture in
a cloud platform, and diagnoses the disease with state of the art accuracy.
Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the considerable
time that standard COVID-19 tests take for preliminary diagnosis. The scarcity
of training data and class imbalance issues were effectively tackled in our
approach by the use of Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN)
and model architecture based as a Convolutional Siamese Network with attention
mechanism. The backend model was tested for robustness us-ing publicly
available datasets under two different classification
scenarios(Binary/Multiclass) with minimal and noisy data. The model achieved
pinnacle testing accuracy of 99.30% and 98.40% on the two respective scenarios,
making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live
training scenario was introduced, which helps improve the app performance over
time as data accumulates. Overall, the problems of generalisability of complex
models and data inefficiency is tackled through the model architecture. The app
based setting with semi live training helps in ease of access to reliable
healthcare in the society, as well as help ineffective research of rare
diseases in a minimal data setting.

    <title>Continual Learning Using Multi-view Task Conditional Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Conventional deep learning models have limited capacity in learning multiple
tasks sequentially. The issue of forgetting the previously learned tasks in
continual learning is known as catastrophic forgetting or interference. When
the input data or the goal of learning change, a continual model will learn and
adapt to the new status. However, the model will not remember or recognise any
revisits to the previous states. This causes performance reduction and
re-training curves in dealing with periodic or irregularly reoccurring changes
in the data or goals. The changes in goals or data are referred to as new tasks
in a continual learning model. Most of the continual learning methods have a
task-known setup in which the task identities are known in advance to the
learning model. We propose Multi-view Task Conditional Neural Networks
(Mv-TCNN) that does not require to known the reoccurring tasks in advance. We
evaluate our model on standard datasets using MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and
also a real-world dataset that we have collected in a remote healthcare
monitoring study (i.e. TIHM dataset). The proposed model outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions in continual learning and adapting to new tasks that
are not defined in advance.

    <title>ISeeU: Visually interpretable deep learning for mortality prediction
  inside the ICU</title>
    <summary>  To improve the performance of Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the field of
bio-statistics has developed scores which try to predict the likelihood of
negative outcomes. These help evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and
clinical practice, and also help to identify patients with unexpected outcomes.
However, they have been shown by several studies to offer sub-optimal
performance. Alternatively, Deep Learning offers state of the art capabilities
in certain prediction tasks and research suggests deep neural networks are able
to outperform traditional techniques. Nevertheless, a main impediment for the
adoption of Deep Learning in healthcare is its reduced interpretability, for in
this field it is crucial to gain insight on the why of predictions, to assure
that models are actually learning relevant features instead of spurious
correlations. To address this, we propose a deep multi-scale convolutional
architecture trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) for mortality prediction, and the use of concepts from coalitional
game theory to construct visual explanations aimed to show how important these
inputs are deemed by the network. Our results show our model attains state of
the art performance while remaining interpretable. Supporting code can be found

    <title>Deep Ensemble Bayesian Active Learning : Addressing the Mode Collapse
  issue in Monte Carlo dropout via Ensembles</title>
    <summary>  In image classification tasks, the ability of deep CNNs to deal with complex
image data has proven to be unrivalled. However, they require large amounts of
labeled training data to reach their full potential. In specialised domains
such as healthcare, labeled data can be difficult and expensive to obtain.
Active Learning aims to alleviate this problem, by reducing the amount of
labelled data needed for a specific task while delivering satisfactory
performance. We propose DEBAL, a new active learning strategy designed for deep
neural networks. This method improves upon the current state-of-the-art deep
Bayesian active learning method, which suffers from the mode collapse problem.
We correct for this deficiency by making use of the expressive power and
statistical properties of model ensembles. Our proposed method manages to
capture superior data uncertainty, which translates into improved
classification performance. We demonstrate empirically that our ensemble method
yields faster convergence of CNNs trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

    <title>Detecting Shortcut Learning for Fair Medical AI using Shortcut Testing</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for improving healthcare, but it is
critical to ensure that its use will not propagate or amplify health
disparities. An important step is to characterize the (un)fairness of ML models
- their tendency to perform differently across subgroups of the population -
and to understand its underlying mechanisms. One potential driver of
algorithmic unfairness, shortcut learning, arises when ML models base
predictions on improper correlations in the training data. However, diagnosing
this phenomenon is difficult, especially when sensitive attributes are causally
linked with disease. Using multi-task learning, we propose the first method to
assess and mitigate shortcut learning as a part of the fairness assessment of
clinical ML systems, and demonstrate its application to clinical tasks in
radiology and dermatology. Finally, our approach reveals instances when
shortcutting is not responsible for unfairness, highlighting the need for a
holistic approach to fairness mitigation in medical AI.

    <title>Boosting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Action Preference Query</title>
    <summary>  Training practical agents usually involve offline and online reinforcement
learning (RL) to balance the policy's performance and interaction costs. In
particular, online fine-tuning has become a commonly used method to correct the
erroneous estimates of out-of-distribution data learned in the offline training
phase. However, even limited online interactions can be inaccessible or
catastrophic for high-stake scenarios like healthcare and autonomous driving.
In this work, we introduce an interaction-free training scheme dubbed
Offline-with-Action-Preferences (OAP). The main insight is that, compared to
online fine-tuning, querying the preferences between pre-collected and learned
actions can be equally or even more helpful to the erroneous estimate problem.
By adaptively encouraging or suppressing policy constraint according to action
preferences, OAP could distinguish overestimation from beneficial policy
improvement and thus attains a more accurate evaluation of unseen data.
Theoretically, we prove a lower bound of the behavior policy's performance
improvement brought by OAP. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that OAP yields higher
(29% on average) scores, especially on challenging AntMaze tasks (98% higher).

    <title>Explaining by Imitating: Understanding Decisions by Interpretable Policy
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Understanding human behavior from observed data is critical for transparency
and accountability in decision-making. Consider real-world settings such as
healthcare, in which modeling a decision-maker's policy is challenging -- with
no access to underlying states, no knowledge of environment dynamics, and no
allowance for live experimentation. We desire learning a data-driven
representation of decision-making behavior that (1) inheres transparency by
design, (2) accommodates partial observability, and (3) operates completely
offline. To satisfy these key criteria, we propose a novel model-based Bayesian
method for interpretable policy learning ("Interpole") that jointly estimates
an agent's (possibly biased) belief-update process together with their
(possibly suboptimal) belief-action mapping. Through experiments on both
simulated and real-world data for the problem of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,
we illustrate the potential of our approach as an investigative device for
auditing, quantifying, and understanding human decision-making behavior.

    <title>Smart Policy Control for Securing Federated Learning Management System</title>
    <summary>  The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities,
intelligent healthcare systems, and various real-world applications have
resulted in the generation of vast amounts of data, often analyzed using
different Machine Learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) has been
acknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where
multiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data.
However, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the
training process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by
each FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability
available in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart
contract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL)
management system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local
training policy control on the FL participants' side. This policy control is
used to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process
follows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart
contract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation
process. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on
blockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global
model and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses
smart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine
learning models. We conducted multiple experiments with various machine
learning architectures and datasets to evaluate our proposed framework, such as
MNIST and CIFAR-10.

    <title>An Explainable Machine Learning Model for Early Detection of Parkinson's
  Disease using LIME on DaTscan Imagery</title>
    <summary>  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative and progressive neurological
condition. Early diagnosis can improve treatment for patients and is performed
through dopaminergic imaging techniques like the SPECT DaTscan. In this study,
we propose a machine learning model that accurately classifies any given
DaTscan as having Parkinson's disease or not, in addition to providing a
plausible reason for the prediction. This is kind of reasoning is done through
the use of visual indicators generated using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explainer (LIME) methods. DaTscans were drawn from the Parkinson's Progression
Markers Initiative database and trained on a CNN (VGG16) using transfer
learning, yielding an accuracy of 95.2%, a sensitivity of 97.5%, and a
specificity of 90.9%. Keeping model interpretability of paramount importance,
especially in the healthcare field, this study utilises LIME explanations to
distinguish PD from non-PD, using visual superpixels on the DaTscans. It could
be concluded that the proposed system, in union with its measured
interpretability and accuracy may effectively aid medical workers in the early
diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.

    <title>Wireless Sensor Networks anomaly detection using Machine Learning: A
  Survey</title>
    <summary>  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become increasingly valuable in various
civil/military applications like industrial process control, civil engineering
applications such as buildings structural strength monitoring, environmental
monitoring, border intrusion, IoT (Internet of Things), and healthcare.
However, the sensed data generated by WSNs is often noisy and unreliable,
making it a challenge to detect and diagnose anomalies. Machine learning (ML)
techniques have been widely used to address this problem by detecting and
identifying unusual patterns in the sensed data. This survey paper provides an
overview of the state of the art applications of ML techniques for data anomaly
detection in WSN domains. We first introduce the characteristics of WSNs and
the challenges of anomaly detection in WSNs. Then, we review various ML
techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning that
have been applied to WSN data anomaly detection. We also compare different
ML-based approaches and their performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we
discuss open research challenges and future directions for applying ML
techniques in WSNs sensed data anomaly detection.

  Unsupervised Logistic Regression (OFS-ULR) Model with Spark Streaming</title>
    <summary>  Recent advancement in the field of pervasive healthcare monitoring systems
causes the generation of a huge amount of lifelog data in real-time. Chronic
diseases are one of the most serious health challenges in developing and
developed countries. According to WHO, this accounts for 73% of all deaths and
60% of the global burden of diseases. Chronic disease classification models are
now harnessing the potential of lifelog data to explore better healthcare
practices. This paper is to construct an optimal feature selection-based
unsupervised logistic regression model (OFS-ULR) to classify chronic diseases.
Since lifelog data analysis is crucial due to its sensitive nature; thus the
conventional classification models show limited performance. Therefore,
designing new classifiers for the classification of chronic diseases using
lifelog data is the need of the age. The vital part of building a good model
depends on pre-processing of the dataset, identifying important features, and
then training a learning algorithm with suitable hyper parameters for better
performance. The proposed approach improves the performance of existing methods
using a series of steps such as (i) removing redundant or invalid instances,
(ii) making the data labelled using clustering and partitioning the data into
classes, (iii) identifying the suitable subset of features by applying either
some domain knowledge or selection algorithm, (iv) hyper parameter tuning for
models to get best results, and (v) performance evaluation using Spark
streaming environment. For this purpose, two-time series datasets are used in
the experiment to compute the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score. The
experimental analysis proves the suitability of the proposed approach as
compared to the conventional classifiers and our newly constructed model
achieved highest accuracy and reduced training complexity among all among all.

    <title>Smart Fog: Fog Computing Framework for Unsupervised Clustering Analytics
  in Wearable Internet of Things</title>
    <summary>  The increasing use of wearables in smart telehealth generates heterogeneous
medical big data. Cloud and fog services process these data for assisting
clinical procedures. IoT based ehealthcare have greatly benefited from
efficient data processing. This paper proposed and evaluated use of low
resource machine learning on Fog devices kept close to the wearables for smart
healthcare. In state of the art telecare systems, the signal processing and
machine learning modules are deployed in the cloud for processing physiological
data. We developed a prototype of Fog-based unsupervised machine learning big
data analysis for discovering patterns in physiological data. We employed Intel
Edison and Raspberry Pi as Fog computer in proposed architecture. We performed
validation studies on real-world pathological speech data from in home
monitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Proposed architecture
employed machine learning for analysis of pathological speech data obtained
from smartwatches worn by the patients with PD. Results showed that proposed
architecture is promising for low-resource clinical machine learning. It could
be useful for other applications within wearable IoT for smart telehealth
scenarios by translating machine learning approaches from the cloud backend to
edge computing devices such as Fog.

    <title>Predicting Injectable Medication Adherence via a Smart Sharps Bin and
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Medication non-adherence is a widespread problem affecting over 50% of people
who have chronic illness and need chronic treatment. Non-adherence exacerbates
health risks and drives significant increases in treatment costs. In order to
address these challenges, the importance of predicting patients' adherence has
been recognised. In other words, it is important to improve the efficiency of
interventions of the current healthcare system by prioritizing resources to the
patients who are most likely to be non-adherent. Our objective in this work is
to make predictions regarding individual patients' behaviour in terms of taking
their medication on time during their next scheduled medication opportunity. We
do this by leveraging a number of machine learning models. In particular, we
demonstrate the use of a connected IoT device; a "Smart Sharps Bin", invented
by HealthBeacon Ltd.; to monitor and track injection disposal of patients in
their home environment. Using extensive data collected from these devices, five
machine learning models, namely Extra Trees Classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost,
Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perception were trained and evaluated on a
large dataset comprising 165,223 historic injection disposal records collected
from 5,915 HealthBeacon units over the course of 3 years. The testing work was
conducted on real-time data generated by the smart device over a time period
after the model training was complete, i.e. true future data. The proposed
machine learning approach demonstrated very good predictive performance
exhibiting an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC)
of 0.86.

    <title>Uncertainty-aware INVASE: Enhanced Breast Cancer Diagnosis Feature
  Selection</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present an uncertainty-aware INVASE to quantify predictive
confidence of healthcare problem. By introducing learnable Gaussian
distributions, we lever-age their variances to measure the degree of
uncertainty. Based on the vanilla INVASE, two additional modules are proposed,
i.e., an uncertainty quantification module in the predictor, and a reward
shaping module in the selector. We conduct extensive experiments on UCI-WDBC
dataset. Notably, our method eliminates almost all predictive bias with only
about 20% queries, while the uncertainty-agnostic counterpart requires nearly
100% queries. The open-source implementation with a detailed tutorial is
available at
https://github.com/jx-zhong-for-academic-purpose/Uncertainty-aware-INVASE/blob/main/tutorialinvase%2B.ipynb.

    <title>Diffusion-Augmented Neural Processes</title>
    <summary>  Over the last few years, Neural Processes have become a useful modelling tool
in many application areas, such as healthcare and climate sciences, in which
data are scarce and prediction uncertainty estimates are indispensable.
However, the current state of the art in the field (AR CNPs; Bruinsma et al.,
2023) presents a few issues that prevent its widespread deployment. This work
proposes an alternative, diffusion-based approach to NPs which, through
conditioning on noised datasets, addresses many of these limitations, whilst
also exceeding SOTA performance.

rock climbing environments using a virtual avatar. Our diffusion transformer
predicts the sample instead of noise in each diffusion step and ingests entire

    <title>An adversarial learning framework for preserving users' anonymity in
  face-based emotion recognition</title>
    <summary>  Image and video-capturing technologies have permeated our every-day life.
Such technologies can continuously monitor individuals' expressions in
real-life settings, affording us new insights into their emotional states and
transitions, thus paving the way to novel well-being and healthcare
applications. Yet, due to the strong privacy concerns, the use of such
technologies is met with strong skepticism, since current face-based emotion
recognition systems relying on deep learning techniques tend to preserve
substantial information related to the identity of the user, apart from the
emotion-specific information. This paper proposes an adversarial learning
framework which relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
trained through an iterative procedure for minimizing identity-specific
information and maximizing emotion-dependent information. The proposed approach
is evaluated through emotion classification and face identification metrics,
and is compared against two CNNs, one trained solely for emotion recognition
and the other trained solely for face identification. Experiments are performed
using the Yale Face Dataset and Japanese Female Facial Expression Database.
Results indicate that the proposed approach can learn a convolutional
transformation for preserving emotion recognition accuracy and degrading face
identity recognition, providing a foundation toward privacy-aware emotion
recognition technologies.

    <title>Near-Optimal Differentially Private Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by personalized healthcare and other applications involving
sensitive data, we study online exploration in reinforcement learning with
differential privacy (DP) constraints. Existing work on this problem
established that no-regret learning is possible under joint differential
privacy (JDP) and local differential privacy (LDP) but did not provide an
algorithm with optimal regret. We close this gap for the JDP case by designing
an $\epsilon$-JDP algorithm with a regret of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{SAH^2T}+S^2AH^3/\epsilon)$ which matches the
information-theoretic lower bound of non-private learning for all choices of
$\epsilon&gt; S^{1.5}A^{0.5} H^2/\sqrt{T}$. In the above, $S$, $A$ denote the
number of states and actions, $H$ denotes the planning horizon, and $T$ is the
number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first private RL
algorithm that achieves \emph{privacy for free} asymptotically as $T\rightarrow
\infty$. Our techniques -- which could be of independent interest -- include
privately releasing Bernstein-type exploration bonuses and an improved method
for releasing visitation statistics. The same techniques also imply a slightly
improved regret bound for the LDP case.

    <title>Characterizing personalized effects of family information on disease
  risk using graph representation learning</title>
    <summary>  Family history is considered a risk factor for many diseases because it
implicitly captures shared genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.
Finland's nationwide electronic health record (EHR) system spanning multiple
generations presents new opportunities for studying a connected network of
medical histories for entire families. In this work we present a graph-based
deep learning approach for learning explainable, supervised representations of
how each family member's longitudinal medical history influences a patient's
disease risk. We demonstrate that this approach is beneficial for predicting
10-year disease onset for 5 complex disease phenotypes, compared to
clinically-inspired and deep learning baselines for Finland's nationwide EHR
system comprising 7 million individuals with up to third-degree relatives.
Through the use of graph explainability techniques, we illustrate that a
graph-based approach enables more personalized modeling of family information
and disease risk by identifying important relatives and features for
prediction.

    <title>Multi-Task Learning with Summary Statistics</title>
    <summary>  Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning paradigm for
integrating data from multiple sources, leveraging similarities between tasks
to improve overall model performance. However, the application of multi-task
learning to real-world settings is hindered by data-sharing constraints,
especially in healthcare settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
flexible multi-task learning framework utilizing summary statistics from
various sources. Additionally, we present an adaptive parameter selection
approach based on a variant of Lepski's method, allowing for data-driven tuning
parameter selection when only summary statistics are available. Our systematic
non-asymptotic analysis characterizes the performance of the proposed methods
under various regimes of the sample complexity and overlap. We demonstrate our
theoretical findings and the performance of the method through extensive
simulations. This work offers a more flexible tool for training related models
across various domains, with practical implications in genetic risk prediction
and many other fields.

    <title>Incentivized Learning in Principal-Agent Bandit Games</title>
    <summary>  This work considers a repeated principal-agent bandit game, where the
principal can only interact with her environment through the agent. The
principal and the agent have misaligned objectives and the choice of action is
only left to the agent. However, the principal can influence the agent's
decisions by offering incentives which add up to his rewards. The principal
aims to iteratively learn an incentive policy to maximize her own total
utility. This framework extends usual bandit problems and is motivated by
several practical applications, such as healthcare or ecological taxation,
where traditionally used mechanism design theories often overlook the learning
aspect of the problem. We present nearly optimal (with respect to a horizon
$T$) learning algorithms for the principal's regret in both multi-armed and
linear contextual settings. Finally, we support our theoretical guarantees
through numerical experiments.

    <title>On the Fairness of Swarm Learning in Skin Lesion Classification</title>
    <summary>  in healthcare. However, the existing AI model may be biased in its decision
marking. The bias induced by data itself, such as collecting data in subgroups
only, can be mitigated by including more diversified data. Distributed and
collaborative learning is an approach to involve training models in massive,
heterogeneous, and distributed data sources, also known as nodes. In this work,
we target on examining the fairness issue in Swarm Learning (SL), a recent
edge-computing based decentralized machine learning approach, which is designed
for heterogeneous illnesses detection in precision medicine. SL has achieved
high performance in clinical applications, but no attempt has been made to
evaluate if SL can improve fairness. To address the problem, we present an
empirical study by comparing the fairness among single (node) training, SL,
centralized training. Specifically, we evaluate on large public available skin
lesion dataset, which contains samples from various subgroups. The experiments
demonstrate that SL does not exacerbate the fairness problem compared to
centralized training and improves both performance and fairness compared to
single training. However, there still exists biases in SL model and the
implementation of SL is more complex than the alternative two strategies.

    <title>Sparse Linear Dynamical System with Its Application in Multivariate
  Clinical Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Linear Dynamical System (LDS) is an elegant mathematical framework for
modeling and learning multivariate time series. However, in general, it is
difficult to set the dimension of its hidden state space. A small number of
hidden states may not be able to model the complexities of a time series, while
a large number of hidden states can lead to overfitting. In this paper, we
study methods that impose an $\ell_1$ regularization on the transition matrix
of an LDS model to alleviate the problem of choosing the optimal number of
hidden states. We incorporate a generalized gradient descent method into the
Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) framework and use Expectation Maximization (EM) to
iteratively achieve sparsity on the transition matrix of an LDS model. We show
that our Sparse Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) improves the predictive
performance when compared to ordinary LDS on a multivariate clinical time
series dataset.

    <title>AVAC: A Machine Learning based Adaptive RRAM Variability-Aware
  Controller for Edge Devices</title>
    <summary>  Recently, the Edge Computing paradigm has gained significant popularity both
in industry and academia. Researchers now increasingly target to improve
performance and reduce energy consumption of such devices. Some recent efforts
focus on using emerging RRAM technologies for improving energy efficiency,
thanks to their no leakage property and high integration density. As the
complexity and dynamism of applications supported by such devices escalate, it
has become difficult to maintain ideal performance by static RRAM controllers.
Machine Learning provides a promising solution for this, and hence, this work
focuses on extending such controllers to allow dynamic parameter updates. In
this work we propose an Adaptive RRAM Variability-Aware Controller, AVAC, which
periodically updates Wait Buffer and batch sizes using on-the-fly learning
models and gradient ascent. AVAC allows Edge devices to adapt to different
applications and their stages, to improve computation performance and reduce
energy consumption. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed model can provide
up to 29% increase in performance and 19% decrease in energy, compared to
static controllers, using traces of real-life healthcare applications on a
Raspberry-Pi based Edge deployment.

    <title>Balance Regularized Neural Network Models for Causal Effect Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Estimating individual and average treatment effects from observational data
is an important problem in many domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. In
this paper, we advocate balance regularization of multi-head neural network
architectures. Our work is motivated by representation learning techniques to
reduce differences between treated and untreated distributions that potentially
arise due to confounding factors. We further regularize the model by
encouraging it to predict control outcomes for individuals in the treatment
group that are similar to control outcomes in the control group. We empirically
study the bias-variance trade-off between different weightings of the
regularizers, as well as between inductive and transductive inference.

    <title>Privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning on genomic data using
  TensorFlow</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) methods have been widely used in genomic studies.
However, genomic data are often held by different stakeholders (e.g. hospitals,
universities, and healthcare companies) who consider the data as sensitive
information, even though they desire to collaborate. To address this issue,
recent works have proposed solutions using Secure Multi-party Computation
(MPC), which train on the decentralized data in a way that the participants
could learn nothing from each other beyond the final trained model.
  We design and implement several MPC-friendly ML primitives, including class
weight adjustment and parallelizable approximation of activation function. In
addition, we develop the solution as an extension to TF
Encrypted~\citep{dahl2018private}, enabling us to quickly experiment with
enhancements of both machine learning techniques and cryptographic protocols
while leveraging the advantages of TensorFlow's optimizations. Our
implementation compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, winning first
place in Track IV of the iDASH2019 secure genome analysis competition.

    <title>Attack-agnostic Adversarial Detection on Medical Data Using Explainable
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Explainable machine learning has become increasingly prevalent, especially in
healthcare where explainable models are vital for ethical and trusted automated
decision making. Work on the susceptibility of deep learning models to
adversarial attacks has shown the ease of designing samples to mislead a model
into making incorrect predictions. In this work, we propose a model agnostic
explainability-based method for the accurate detection of adversarial samples
on two datasets with different complexity and properties: Electronic Health
Record (EHR) and chest X-ray (CXR) data. On the MIMIC-III and Henan-Renmin EHR
datasets, we report a detection accuracy of 77% against the Longitudinal
Adversarial Attack. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 88%;
significantly improving on the state of the art of adversarial detection in
both datasets by over 10% in all settings. We propose an anomaly detection
based method using explainability techniques to detect adversarial samples
which is able to generalise to different attack methods without a need for
retraining.

    <title>Balancing Explainability-Accuracy of Complex Models</title>
    <summary>  Explainability of AI models is an important topic that can have a significant
impact in all domains and applications from autonomous driving to healthcare.
The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple
machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the
explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are
concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and
deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex
models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability
considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose
approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features.
In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output.
Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our
proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on
the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a
reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space
with a smaller number of observations.

    <title>Survival-oriented embeddings for improving accessibility to complex data
  structures</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning excels in the analysis of unstructured data and recent
advancements allow to extend these techniques to survival analysis. In the
context of clinical radiology, this enables, e.g., to relate unstructured
volumetric images to a risk score or a prognosis of life expectancy and support
clinical decision making. Medical applications are, however, associated with
high criticality and consequently, neither medical personnel nor patients do
usually accept black box models as reason or basis for decisions. Apart from
averseness to new technologies, this is due to missing interpretability,
transparency and accountability of many machine learning methods. We propose a
hazard-regularized variational autoencoder that supports straightforward
interpretation of deep neural architectures in the context of survival
analysis, a field highly relevant in healthcare. We apply the proposed approach
to abdominal CT scans of patients with liver tumors and their corresponding
survival times.

    <title>Interpretable Drug Synergy Prediction with Graph Neural Networks for
  Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  We investigate molecular mechanisms of resistant or sensitive response of
cancer drug combination therapies in an inductive and interpretable manner.
Though deep learning algorithms are widely used in the drug synergy prediction
problem, it is still an open problem to formulate the prediction model with
biological meaning to investigate the mysterious mechanisms of synergy (MoS)
for the human-AI collaboration in healthcare systems. To address the
challenges, we propose a deep graph neural network, IDSP (Interpretable Deep
Signaling Pathways), to incorporate the gene-gene as well as gene-drug
regulatory relationships in synergic drug combination predictions. IDSP
automatically learns weights of edges based on the gene and drug node
relations, i.e., signaling interactions, by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and
aggregates information in an inductive manner. The proposed architecture
generates interpretable drug synergy prediction by detecting important
signaling interactions, and can be implemented when the underlying molecular
mechanism encounters unseen genes or signaling pathways. We test IDWSP on
signaling networks formulated by genes from 46 core cancer signaling pathways
and drug combinations from NCI ALMANAC drug combination screening data. The
experimental results demonstrated that 1) IDSP can learn from the underlying
molecular mechanism to make prediction without additional drug chemical
information while achieving highly comparable performance with current
state-of-art methods; 2) IDSP show superior generality and flexibility to
implement the synergy prediction task on both transductive tasks and inductive
tasks. 3) IDSP can generate interpretable results by detecting different
salient signaling patterns (i.e. MoS) for different cell lines.

    <title>Semi-supervised reward learning for offline reinforcement learning</title>
    <summary>  In offline reinforcement learning (RL) agents are trained using a logged
dataset. It appears to be the most natural route to attack real-life
applications because in domains such as healthcare and robotics interactions
with the environment are either expensive or unethical. Training agents usually
requires reward functions, but unfortunately, rewards are seldom available in
practice and their engineering is challenging and laborious. To overcome this,
we investigate reward learning under the constraint of minimizing human reward
annotations. We consider two types of supervision: timestep annotations and
demonstrations. We propose semi-supervised learning algorithms that learn from
limited annotations and incorporate unlabelled data. In our experiments with a
simulated robotic arm, we greatly improve upon behavioural cloning and closely
approach the performance achieved with ground truth rewards. We further
investigate the relationship between the quality of the reward model and the
final policies. We notice, for example, that the reward models do not need to
be perfect to result in useful policies.

    <title>Self-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Time Series
  Anomaly Detection</title>
    <summary>  Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) finds widespread applications across
various domains such as financial markets, industrial production, and
healthcare. Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time
series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD
methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the
semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN).
STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality
learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences,
and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that
learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By
synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal
representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data.
Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is

    <title>The Role of Explainability in Assuring Safety of Machine Learning in
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are
difficult to apply to systems employing ML where there is no clear, pre-defined
specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by
the "opaque" nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human
scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue
by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help
users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work
explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the
context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can
contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete
ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from
mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to
produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented
in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute
to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in
safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not
sufficient in themselves to assure safety.

    <title>Interpretable COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Classification via Orthogonality
  Constraint</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in
healthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several
diagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical
settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,
and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have
been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to
gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their
acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of
using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases
from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple
orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard
cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies
have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep
learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that
the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic
localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,
and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in
accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,
respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation
applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new
application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc
interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19
classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We
also identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further
research in future.

    <title>Neural architecture impact on identifying temporally extended
  Reinforcement Learning tasks</title>
    <summary>  Inspired by recent developments in attention models for image classification
and natural language processing, we present various Attention based
architectures in reinforcement learning (RL) domain, capable of performing well
on OpenAI Gym Atari-2600 game suite. In spite of the recent success of Deep
Reinforcement learning techniques in various fields like robotics, gaming and
healthcare, they suffer from a major drawback that neural networks are
difficult to interpret. We try to get around this problem with the help of
Attention based models. In Attention based models, extracting and overlaying of
attention map onto images allows for direct observation of information used by
agent to select actions and easier interpretation of logic behind the chosen
actions. Our models in addition to playing well on gym-Atari environments, also
provide insights on how agent perceives its environment. In addition, motivated
by recent developments in attention based video-classification models using
Vision Transformer, we come up with an architecture based on Vision
Transformer, for image-based RL domain too. Compared to previous works in
Vision Transformer, our model is faster to train and requires fewer
computational resources. 3

    <title>Machine Learning for Synthetic Data Generation: A Review</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning heavily relies on data, but real-world applications often
encounter various data-related issues. These include data of poor quality,
insufficient data points leading to under-fitting of machine learning models,
and difficulties in data access due to concerns surrounding privacy, safety,
and regulations. In light of these challenges, the concept of synthetic data
generation emerges as a promising alternative that allows for data sharing and
utilization in ways that real-world data cannot facilitate. This paper presents
a comprehensive systematic review of existing studies that employ machine
learning models for the purpose of generating synthetic data. The review
encompasses various perspectives, starting with the applications of synthetic
data generation, spanning computer vision, speech, natural language processing,
healthcare, and business domains. Additionally, it explores different machine
learning methods, with particular emphasis on neural network architectures and
deep generative models. The paper also addresses the crucial aspects of privacy
and fairness concerns related to synthetic data generation. Furthermore, this
study identifies the challenges and opportunities prevalent in this emerging
field, shedding light on the potential avenues for future research. By delving
into the intricacies of synthetic data generation, this paper aims to
contribute to the advancement of knowledge and inspire further exploration in
synthetic data generation.

    <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Survival Analysis</title>
    <summary>  With the spread and rapid advancement of black box machine learning models,
the field of interpretable machine learning (IML) or explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important over the last decade. This
is particularly relevant for survival analysis, where the adoption of IML
techniques promotes transparency, accountability and fairness in sensitive
areas, such as clinical decision making processes, the development of targeted
therapies, interventions or in other medical or healthcare related contexts.
More specifically, explainability can uncover a survival model's potential
biases and limitations and provide more mathematically sound ways to understand
how and which features are influential for prediction or constitute risk
factors. However, the lack of readily available IML methods may have deterred
medical practitioners and policy makers in public health from leveraging the
full potential of machine learning for predicting time-to-event data. We
present a comprehensive review of the limited existing amount of work on IML
methods for survival analysis within the context of the general IML taxonomy.
In addition, we formally detail how commonly used IML methods, such as such as
individual conditional expectation (ICE), partial dependence plots (PDP),
accumulated local effects (ALE), different feature importance measures or
Friedman's H-interaction statistics can be adapted to survival outcomes. An
application of several IML methods to real data on data on under-5 year
mortality of Ghanaian children from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
Program serves as a tutorial or guide for researchers, on how to utilize the
techniques in practice to facilitate understanding of model decisions or
predictions.

    <title>M$^3$Care: Learning with Missing Modalities in Multimodal Healthcare
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data are widely used in clinical
applications. Conventional methods usually assume that each sample (patient) is
associated with the unified observed modalities, and all modalities are
available for each sample. However, missing modality caused by various clinical
and social reasons is a common issue in real-world clinical scenarios. Existing
methods mostly rely on solving a generative model that learns a mapping from
the latent space to the original input space, which is an unstable ill-posed
inverse problem. To relieve the underdetermined system, we propose a model
solving a direct problem, dubbed learning with Missing Modalities in Multimodal
healthcare data (M3Care). M3Care is an end-to-end model compensating the
missing information of the patients with missing modalities to perform clinical
analysis. Instead of generating raw missing data, M3Care imputes the
task-related information of the missing modalities in the latent space by the
auxiliary information from each patient's similar neighbors, measured by a
task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric, and thence conducts the
clinical tasks. The task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric utilizes
the uncensored modalities of the patient and the other patients who also have
the same uncensored modalities to find similar patients. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that M3Care outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines. Moreover, the findings discovered by M3Care are consistent with
experts and medical knowledge, demonstrating the capability and the potential
of providing useful insights and explanations.

    <title>Robust Learning via Conditional Prevalence Adjustment</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data often come from multiple sites in which the correlations
between confounding variables can vary widely. If deep learning models exploit
these unstable correlations, they might fail catastrophically in unseen sites.
Although many methods have been proposed to tackle unstable correlations, each
has its limitations. For example, adversarial training forces models to
completely ignore unstable correlations, but doing so may lead to poor
predictive performance. Other methods (e.g. Invariant risk minimization [4])
try to learn domain-invariant representations that rely only on stable
associations by assuming a causal data-generating process (input X causes class
label Y ). Thus, they may be ineffective for anti-causal tasks (Y causes X),
which are common in computer vision. We propose a method called CoPA
(Conditional Prevalence-Adjustment) for anti-causal tasks. CoPA assumes that
(1) generation mechanism is stable, i.e. label Y and confounding variable(s) Z
generate X, and (2) the unstable conditional prevalence in each site E fully
accounts for the unstable correlations between X and Y . Our crucial
observation is that confounding variables are routinely recorded in healthcare
settings and the prevalence can be readily estimated, for example, from a set
of (Y, Z) samples (no need for corresponding samples of X). CoPA can work even
if there is a single training site, a scenario which is often overlooked by
existing methods. Our experiments on synthetic and real data show CoPA beating
competitive baselines.

    <title>Estimating individual treatment effect: generalization bounds and
  algorithms</title>
    <summary>  There is intense interest in applying machine learning to problems of causal
inference in fields such as healthcare, economics and education. In particular,
individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision
medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for
predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the
assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a "balanced"
representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look
similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound
showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded
by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the
distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the
representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances
between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show
the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.

    <title>Interpretable Sequence Learning for COVID-19 Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel approach that integrates machine learning into
compartmental disease modeling to predict the progression of COVID-19. Our
model is explainable by design as it explicitly shows how different
compartments evolve and it uses interpretable encoders to incorporate
covariates and improve performance. Explainability is valuable to ensure that
the model's forecasts are credible to epidemiologists and to instill confidence
in end-users such as policy makers and healthcare institutions. Our model can
be applied at different geographic resolutions, and here we demonstrate it for
states and counties in the United States. We show that our model provides more
accurate forecasts, in metrics averaged across the entire US, than
state-of-the-art alternatives, and that it provides qualitatively meaningful
explanatory insights. Lastly, we analyze the performance of our model for
different subgroups based on the subgroup distributions within the counties.

    <title>Interpretability Aware Model Training to Improve Robustness against
  Out-of-Distribution Magnetic Resonance Images in Alzheimer's Disease
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  Owing to its pristine soft-tissue contrast and high resolution, structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely applied in neurology, making it a
valuable data source for image-based machine learning (ML) and deep learning
applications. The physical nature of MRI acquisition and reconstruction,
however, causes variations in image intensity, resolution, and signal-to-noise
ratio. Since ML models are sensitive to such variations, performance on
out-of-distribution data, which is inherent to the setting of a deployed
healthcare ML application, typically drops below acceptable levels. We propose
an interpretability aware adversarial training regime to improve robustness
against out-of-distribution samples originating from different MRI hardware.
The approach is applied to 1.5T and 3T MRIs obtained from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We present preliminary results
showing promising performance on out-of-distribution samples.

    <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation across FMCW Radar Configurations Using
  Margin Disparity Discrepancy</title>
    <summary>  Commercial radar sensing is gaining relevance and machine learning algorithms
constitute one of the key components that are enabling the spread of this radio
technology into areas like surveillance or healthcare. However, radar datasets
are still scarce and generalization cannot be yet achieved for all radar
systems, environment conditions or design parameters. A certain degree of fine
tuning is, therefore, usually required to deploy machine-learning-enabled radar
applications. In this work, we consider the problem of unsupervised domain
adaptation across radar configurations in the context of deep-learning human
activity classification using frequency-modulated continuous-wave. For that, we
focus on the theory-inspired technique of Margin Disparity Discrepancy, which
has already been proved successful in the area of computer vision. Our
experiments extend this technique to radar data, achieving a comparable
accuracy to fewshot supervised approaches for the same classification problem.

    <title>PAC-Bayes Bounds for Bandit Problems: A Survey and Experimental
  Comparison</title>
    <summary>  PAC-Bayes has recently re-emerged as an effective theory with which one can
derive principled learning algorithms with tight performance guarantees.
However, applications of PAC-Bayes to bandit problems are relatively rare,
which is a great misfortune. Many decision-making problems in healthcare,
finance and natural sciences can be modelled as bandit problems. In many of
these applications, principled algorithms with strong performance guarantees
would be very much appreciated. This survey provides an overview of PAC-Bayes
bounds for bandit problems and an experimental comparison of these bounds. On
the one hand, we found that PAC-Bayes bounds are a useful tool for designing
offline bandit algorithms with performance guarantees. In our experiments, a
PAC-Bayesian offline contextual bandit algorithm was able to learn randomised
neural network polices with competitive expected reward and non-vacuous
performance guarantees. On the other hand, the PAC-Bayesian online bandit
algorithms that we tested had loose cumulative regret bounds. We conclude by
discussing some topics for future work on PAC-Bayesian bandit algorithms.

    <title>Reinforced Sequential Decision-Making for Sepsis Treatment: The POSNEGDM
  Framework with Mortality Classifier and Transformer</title>
    <summary>  Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by the body's exaggerated
response to infection, demands urgent intervention to prevent severe
complications. Existing machine learning methods for managing sepsis struggle
in offline scenarios, exhibiting suboptimal performance with survival rates
below 50%. This paper introduces the POSNEGDM -- ``Reinforcement Learning with
Positive and Negative Demonstrations for Sequential Decision-Making" framework
utilizing an innovative transformer-based model and a feedback reinforcer to
replicate expert actions while considering individual patient characteristics.
A mortality classifier with 96.7\% accuracy guides treatment decisions towards
positive outcomes. The POSNEGDM framework significantly improves patient
survival, saving 97.39% of patients, outperforming established machine learning
algorithms (Decision Transformer and Behavioral Cloning) with survival rates of
33.4% and 43.5%, respectively. Additionally, ablation studies underscore the
critical role of the transformer-based decision maker and the integration of a
mortality classifier in enhancing overall survival rates. In summary, our
proposed approach presents a promising avenue for enhancing sepsis treatment
outcomes, contributing to improved patient care and reduced healthcare costs.

    <title>Comparison of Privacy-Preserving Distributed Deep Learning Methods in
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we compare three privacy-preserving distributed learning
techniques: federated learning, split learning, and SplitFed. We use these
techniques to develop binary classification models for detecting tuberculosis
from chest X-rays and compare them in terms of classification performance,
communication and computational costs, and training time. We propose a novel
distributed learning architecture called SplitFedv3, which performs better than
split learning and SplitFedv2 in our experiments. We also propose alternate
mini-batch training, a new training technique for split learning, that performs
better than alternate client training, where clients take turns to train a
model.

    <title>Neural ODEs for Informative Missingness in Multivariate Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Informative missingness is unavoidable in the digital processing of
continuous time series, where the value for one or more observations at
different time points are missing. Such missing observations are one of the
major limitations of time series processing using deep learning. Practical
applications, e.g., sensor data, healthcare, weather, generates data that is in
truth continuous in time, and informative missingness is a common phenomenon in
these datasets. These datasets often consist of multiple variables, and often
there are missing values for one or many of these variables. This
characteristic makes time series prediction more challenging, and the impact of
missing input observations on the accuracy of the final output can be
significant. A recent novel deep learning model called GRU-D is one early
attempt to address informative missingness in time series data. On the other
hand, a new family of neural networks called Neural ODEs (Ordinary Differential
Equations) are natural and efficient for processing time series data which is
continuous in time. In this paper, a deep learning model is proposed that
leverages the effective imputation of GRU-D, and the temporal continuity of
Neural ODEs. A time series classification task performed on the PhysioNet
dataset demonstrates the performance of this architecture.

    <title>Clinical Trial Information Extraction with BERT</title>
    <summary>  Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical trial documents can be useful
in new trial design. Here we identify entity types relevant to clinical trial
design and propose a framework called CT-BERT for information extraction from
clinical trial text. We trained named entity recognition (NER) models to
extract eligibility criteria entities by fine-tuning a set of pre-trained BERT
models. We then compared the performance of CT-BERT with recent baseline
methods including attention-based BiLSTM and Criteria2Query. The results
demonstrate the superiority of CT-BERT in clinical trial NLP.

    <title>The Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Health Disparities</title>
    <summary>  High-quality healthcare in the US can be cost-prohibitive for certain
socioeconomic groups. In this paper, we examined data from the US Census and
the CDC to determine the degree to which specific socioeconomic factors
correlate with both specific and general health metrics. We employed visual
analysis to find broad trends and predictive modeling to identify more complex
relationships between variables. Our results indicate that certain
socioeconomic factors, like income and educational attainment, are highly
correlated with aggregate measures of health.

    <title>Privacy-preserving data release leveraging optimal transport and
  particle gradient descent</title>
    <summary>  We present a novel approach for differentially private data synthesis of
protected tabular datasets, a relevant task in highly sensitive domains such as
healthcare and government. Current state-of-the-art methods predominantly use
marginal-based approaches, where a dataset is generated from private estimates
of the marginals. In this paper, we introduce PrivPGD, a new generation method
for marginal-based private data synthesis, leveraging tools from optimal
transport and particle gradient descent. Our algorithm outperforms existing
methods on a large range of datasets while being highly scalable and offering
the flexibility to incorporate additional domain-specific constraints.

    <title>Deep Learning Approach for Predicting 30 Day Readmissions after Coronary
  Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</title>
    <summary>  Hospital Readmissions within 30 days after discharge following Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery are substantial contributors to healthcare
costs. Many predictive models were developed to identify risk factors for
readmissions. However, majority of the existing models use statistical analysis
techniques with data available at discharge. We propose an ensembled model to
predict CABG readmissions using pre-discharge perioperative data and machine
learning survival analysis techniques. Firstly, we applied fifty one potential
readmission risk variables to Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) survival regression
univariate analysis. Fourteen of them turned out to be significant (with p
value &lt; 0.05), contributing to readmissions. Subsequently, we applied these 14
predictors to multivariate CPH model and Deep Learning Neural Network (NN)
representation of the CPH model, DeepSurv. We validated this new ensembled
model with 453 isolated adult CABG cases. Nine of the fourteen perioperative
risk variables were identified as the most significant with Hazard Ratios (HR)
of greater than 1.0. The concordance index metrics for CPH, DeepSurv, and
ensembled models were then evaluated with training and validation datasets. Our
ensembled model yielded promising results in terms of c-statistics, as we
raised the the number of iterations and data set sizes. 30 day all-cause
readmissions among isolated CABG patients can be predicted more effectively
with perioperative pre-discharge data, using machine learning survival analysis
techniques. Prediction accuracy levels could be improved further with deep
learning algorithms.

    <title>Learning to search efficiently for causally near-optimal treatments</title>
    <summary>  Finding an effective medical treatment often requires a search by trial and
error. Making this search more efficient by minimizing the number of
unnecessary trials could lower both costs and patient suffering. We formalize
this problem as learning a policy for finding a near-optimal treatment in a
minimum number of trials using a causal inference framework. We give a
model-based dynamic programming algorithm which learns from observational data
while being robust to unmeasured confounding. To reduce time complexity, we
suggest a greedy algorithm which bounds the near-optimality constraint. The
methods are evaluated on synthetic and real-world healthcare data and compared
to model-free reinforcement learning. We find that our methods compare
favorably to the model-free baseline while offering a more transparent
trade-off between search time and treatment efficacy.

    <title>VAFL: a Method of Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Horizontal Federated learning (FL) handles multi-client data that share the
same set of features, and vertical FL trains a better predictor that combine
all the features from different clients. This paper targets solving vertical FL
in an asynchronous fashion, and develops a simple FL method. The new method
allows each client to run stochastic gradient algorithms without coordination
with other clients, so it is suitable for intermittent connectivity of clients.
This method further uses a new technique of perturbed local embedding to ensure
data privacy and improve communication efficiency. Theoretically, we present
the convergence rate and privacy level of our method for strongly convex,
nonconvex and even nonsmooth objectives separately. Empirically, we apply our
method to FL on various image and healthcare datasets. The results compare
favorably to centralized and synchronous FL methods.

    <title>A Simple and Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Deep Learning based models are currently dominating most state-of-the-art
solutions for disease prediction. Existing works employ RNNs along with
multiple levels of attention mechanisms to provide interpretability. These deep
learning models, with trainable parameters running into millions, require huge
amounts of compute and data to train and deploy. These requirements are
sometimes so huge that they render usage of such models as unfeasible. We
address these challenges by developing a simpler yet interpretable non-deep
learning based model for application to EHR data. We model and showcase our
work's results on the task of predicting first occurrence of a diagnosis, often
overlooked in existing works. We push the capabilities of a tree based model
and come up with a strong baseline for more sophisticated models. Its
performance shows an improvement over deep learning based solutions (both, with
and without the first-occurrence constraint) all the while maintaining
interpretability.

    <title>Universal EHR Federated Learning Framework</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) is the most practical multi-source learning method
for electronic healthcare records (EHR). Despite its guarantee of privacy
protection, the wide application of FL is restricted by two large challenges:
the heterogeneous EHR systems, and the non-i.i.d. data characteristic. A recent
research proposed a framework that unifies heterogeneous EHRs, named UniHPF. We
attempt to address both the challenges simultaneously by combining UniHPF and
FL. Our study is the first approach to unify heterogeneous EHRs into a single
FL framework. This combination provides an average of 3.4% performance gain
compared to local learning. We believe that our framework is practically
applicable in the real-world FL.

    <title>ACES: Automatic Cohort Extraction System for Event-Stream Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Reproducibility remains a significant challenge in machine learning (ML) for
healthcare. In this field, datasets, model pipelines, and even task/cohort
definitions are often private, leading to a significant barrier in sharing,
iterating, and understanding ML results on electronic health record (EHR)
datasets. In this paper, we address a significant part of this problem by
introducing the Automatic Cohort Extraction System for Event-Stream Datasets
(ACES). This tool is designed to simultaneously simplify the development of
task/cohorts for ML in healthcare and enable the reproduction of these cohorts,
both at an exact level for single datasets and at a conceptual level across
datasets. To accomplish this, ACES provides (1) a highly intuitive and
expressive configuration language for defining both dataset-specific concepts
and dataset-agnostic inclusion/exclusion criteria, and (2) a pipeline to
automatically extract patient records that meet these defined criteria from
real-world data. ACES can be automatically applied to any dataset in either the
Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) or EventStreamGPT (ESGPT) formats, or to
*any* dataset for which the necessary task-specific predicates can be extracted
in an event-stream form. ACES has the potential to significantly lower the
barrier to entry for defining ML tasks, redefine the way researchers interact
with EHR datasets, and significantly improve the state of reproducibility for
ML studies in this modality. ACES is available at

    <title>Fed-BioMed: Open, Transparent and Trusted Federated Learning for
  Real-world Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  The real-world implementation of federated learning is complex and requires
research and development actions at the crossroad between different domains
ranging from data science, to software programming, networking, and security.
While today several FL libraries are proposed to data scientists and users,
most of these frameworks are not designed to find seamless application in
medical use-cases, due to the specific challenges and requirements of working
with medical data and hospital infrastructures. Moreover, governance, design
principles, and security assumptions of these frameworks are generally not
clearly illustrated, thus preventing the adoption in sensitive applications.
Motivated by the current technological landscape of FL in healthcare, in this
document we present Fed-BioMed: a research and development initiative aiming at
translating federated learning (FL) into real-world medical research
applications. We describe our design space, targeted users, domain constraints,
and how these factors affect our current and future software architecture.

    <title>Data-Driven Online Decision Making with Costly Information Acquisition</title>
    <summary>  In most real-world settings such as recommender systems, finance, and
healthcare, collecting useful information is costly and requires an active
choice on the part of the decision maker. The decision-maker needs to learn
simultaneously what observations to make and what actions to take. This paper
incorporates the information acquisition decision into an online learning
framework. We propose two different algorithms for this dual learning problem:
Sim-OOS and Seq-OOS where observations are made simultaneously and
sequentially, respectively. We prove that both algorithms achieve a regret that
is sublinear in time. The developed framework and algorithms can be used in
many applications including medical informatics, recommender systems and
actionable intelligence in transportation, finance, cyber-security etc., in
which collecting information prior to making decisions is costly. We validate
our algorithms in a breast cancer example setting in which we show substantial
performance gains for our proposed algorithms.

    <title>Counterfactually Guided Off-policy Transfer in Clinical Settings</title>
    <summary>  Domain shift, encountered when using a trained model for a new patient
population, creates significant challenges for sequential decision making in
healthcare since the target domain may be both data-scarce and confounded. In
this paper, we propose a method for off-policy transfer by modeling the
underlying generative process with a causal mechanism. We use informative
priors from the source domain to augment counterfactual trajectories in the
target in a principled manner. We demonstrate how this addresses data-scarcity
in the presence of unobserved confounding. The causal parametrization of our
sampling procedure guarantees that counterfactual quantities can be estimated
from scarce observational target data, maintaining intuitive stability
properties. Policy learning in the target domain is further regularized via the
source policy through KL-divergence. Through evaluation on a simulated sepsis
treatment task, our counterfactual policy transfer procedure significantly
improves the performance of a learned treatment policy when assumptions of
"no-unobserved confounding" are relaxed.

    <title>Off-policy Evaluation in Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement Learning with
  Latent Confounders</title>
    <summary>  Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning is an important problem
in settings where experimentation is limited, such as education and healthcare.
But, in these very same settings, observed actions are often confounded by
unobserved variables making OPE even more difficult. We study an OPE problem in
an infinite-horizon, ergodic Markov decision process with unobserved
confounders, where states and actions can act as proxies for the unobserved
confounders. We show how, given only a latent variable model for states and
actions, policy value can be identified from off-policy data. Our method
involves two stages. In the first, we show how to use proxies to estimate
stationary distribution ratios, extending recent work on breaking the curse of
horizon to the confounded setting. In the second, we show optimal balancing can
be combined with such learned ratios to obtain policy value while avoiding
direct modeling of reward functions. We establish theoretical guarantees of
consistency, and benchmark our method empirically.

    <title>Proximal Reinforcement Learning: Efficient Off-Policy Evaluation in
  Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes</title>
    <summary>  In applications of offline reinforcement learning to observational data, such
as in healthcare or education, a general concern is that observed actions might
be affected by unobserved factors, inducing confounding and biasing estimates
derived under the assumption of a perfect Markov decision process (MDP) model.
Here we tackle this by considering off-policy evaluation in a partially
observed MDP (POMDP). Specifically, we consider estimating the value of a given
target policy in a POMDP given trajectories with only partial state
observations generated by a different and unknown policy that may depend on the
unobserved state. We tackle two questions: what conditions allow us to identify
the target policy value from the observed data and, given identification, how
to best estimate it. To answer these, we extend the framework of proximal
causal inference to our POMDP setting, providing a variety of settings where
identification is made possible by the existence of so-called bridge functions.
We then show how to construct semiparametrically efficient estimators in these
settings. We term the resulting framework proximal reinforcement learning
(PRL). We demonstrate the benefits of PRL in an extensive simulation study and
on the problem of sepsis management.

    <title>NLICE: Synthetic Medical Record Generation for Effective Primary
  Healthcare Differential Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  This paper offers a systematic method for creating medical knowledge-grounded
patient records for use in activities involving differential diagnosis.
Additionally, an assessment of machine learning models that can differentiate
between various conditions based on given symptoms is also provided. We use a
public disease-symptom data source called SymCat in combination with Synthea to
construct the patients records. In order to increase the expressive nature of
the synthetic data, we use a medically-standardized symptom modeling method
called NLICE to augment the synthetic data with additional contextual
information for each condition. In addition, Naive Bayes and Random Forest
models are evaluated and compared on the synthetic data. The paper shows how to
successfully construct SymCat-based and NLICE-based datasets. We also show
results for the effectiveness of using the datasets to train predictive disease
models. The SymCat-based dataset is able to train a Naive Bayes and Random
Forest model yielding a 58.8% and 57.1% Top-1 accuracy score, respectively. In
contrast, the NLICE-based dataset improves the results, with a Top-1 accuracy
of 82.0% and Top-5 accuracy values of more than 90% for both models. Our
proposed data generation approach solves a major barrier to the application of
artificial intelligence methods in the healthcare domain. Our novel NLICE
symptom modeling approach addresses the incomplete and insufficient information
problem in the current binary symptom representation approach. The NLICE code
is open sourced at https://github.com/guozhuoran918/NLICE.

    <title>Coarse race data conceals disparities in clinical risk score performance</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data in the United States often records only a patient's coarse
race group: for example, both Indian and Chinese patients are typically coded
as "Asian." It is unknown, however, whether this coarse coding conceals
meaningful disparities in the performance of clinical risk scores across
granular race groups. Here we show that it does. Using data from 418K emergency
department visits, we assess clinical risk score performance disparities across
26 granular groups for three outcomes, five risk scores, and four performance
metrics. Across outcomes and metrics, we show that the risk scores exhibit
significant granular performance disparities within coarse race groups. In
fact, variation in performance within coarse groups often *exceeds* the
variation between coarse groups. We explore why these disparities arise,
finding that outcome rates, feature distributions, and the relationships
between features and outcomes all vary significantly across granular groups.
Our results suggest that healthcare providers, hospital systems, and machine
learning researchers should strive to collect, release, and use granular race
data in place of coarse race data, and that existing analyses may significantly
underestimate racial disparities in performance.

    <title>Interpretable Clustering via Optimal Trees</title>
    <summary>  State-of-the-art clustering algorithms use heuristics to partition the
feature space and provide little insight into the rationale for cluster
membership, limiting their interpretability. In healthcare applications, the
latter poses a barrier to the adoption of these methods since medical
researchers are required to provide detailed explanations of their decisions in
order to gain patient trust and limit liability. We present a new unsupervised
learning algorithm that leverages Mixed Integer Optimization techniques to
generate interpretable tree-based clustering models. Utilizing the flexible
framework of Optimal Trees, our method approximates the globally optimal
solution leading to high quality partitions of the feature space. Our
algorithm, can incorporate various internal validation metrics, naturally
determines the optimal number of clusters, and is able to account for mixed
numeric and categorical data. It achieves comparable or superior performance on
both synthetic and real world datasets when compared to K-Means while offering
significantly higher interpretability.

    <title>In-Memory Resistive RAM Implementation of Binarized Neural Networks for
  Medical Applications</title>
    <summary>  The advent of deep learning has considerably accelerated machine learning
development. The deployment of deep neural networks at the edge is however
limited by their high memory and energy consumption requirements. With new
memory technology available, emerging Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are
promising to reduce the energy impact of the forthcoming machine learning
hardware generation, enabling machine learning on the edge devices and avoiding
data transfer over the network. In this work, after presenting our
implementation employing a hybrid CMOS - hafnium oxide resistive memory
technology, we suggest strategies to apply BNNs to biomedical signals such as
electrocardiography and electroencephalography, keeping accuracy level and
reducing memory requirements. We investigate the memory-accuracy trade-off when
binarizing whole network and binarizing solely the classifier part. We also
discuss how these results translate to the edge-oriented Mobilenet~V1 neural
network on the Imagenet task. The final goal of this research is to enable
smart autonomous healthcare devices.

    <title>TACTiS: Transformer-Attentional Copulas for Time Series</title>
    <summary>  The estimation of time-varying quantities is a fundamental component of
decision making in fields such as healthcare and finance. However, the
practical utility of such estimates is limited by how accurately they quantify
predictive uncertainty. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the
joint predictive distribution of high-dimensional multivariate time series. We
propose a versatile method, based on the transformer architecture, that
estimates joint distributions using an attention-based decoder that provably
learns to mimic the properties of non-parametric copulas. The resulting model
has several desirable properties: it can scale to hundreds of time series,
supports both forecasting and interpolation, can handle unaligned and
non-uniformly sampled data, and can seamlessly adapt to missing data during
training. We demonstrate these properties empirically and show that our model
produces state-of-the-art predictions on multiple real-world datasets.

    <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Uncertainty-aware Nonlinear Variable
  Selection with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
    <summary>  We develop a simple and unified framework for nonlinear variable selection
that incorporates uncertainty in the prediction function and is compatible with
a wide range of machine learning models (e.g., tree ensembles, kernel methods,
neural networks, etc). In particular, for a learned nonlinear model
$f(\mathbf{x})$, we consider quantifying the importance of an input variable
$\mathbf{x}^j$ using the integrated partial derivative $\Psi_j = \Vert
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}^j} f(\mathbf{x})\Vert^2_{P_\mathcal{X}}$.
We then (1) provide a principled approach for quantifying variable selection
uncertainty by deriving its posterior distribution, and (2) show that the
approach is generalizable even to non-differentiable models such as tree
ensembles. Rigorous Bayesian nonparametric theorems are derived to guarantee
the posterior consistency and asymptotic uncertainty of the proposed approach.
Extensive simulations and experiments on healthcare benchmark datasets confirm
that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing classic and recent variable
selection methods.

    <title>DPD-fVAE: Synthetic Data Generation Using Federated Variational
  Autoencoders With Differentially-Private Decoder</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) is getting increased attention for processing
sensitive, distributed datasets common to domains such as healthcare. Instead
of directly training classification models on these datasets, recent works have
considered training data generators capable of synthesising a new dataset which
is not protected by any privacy restrictions. Thus, the synthetic data can be
made available to anyone, which enables further evaluation of machine learning
architectures and research questions off-site. As an additional layer of
privacy-preservation, differential privacy can be introduced into the training
process. We propose DPD-fVAE, a federated Variational Autoencoder with
Differentially-Private Decoder, to synthesise a new, labelled dataset for
subsequent machine learning tasks. By synchronising only the decoder component
with FL, we can reduce the privacy cost per epoch and thus enable better data
generators. In our evaluation on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA, we show the
benefits of DPD-fVAE and report competitive performance to related work in
terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance and accuracy of classifiers trained on
the synthesised dataset.

    <title>MentalHealthAI: Utilizing Personal Health Device Data to Optimize
  Psychiatry Treatment</title>
    <summary>  Mental health disorders remain a significant challenge in modern healthcare,
with diagnosis and treatment often relying on subjective patient descriptions
and past medical history. To address this issue, we propose a personalized
mental health tracking and mood prediction system that utilizes patient
physiological data collected through personal health devices. Our system
leverages a decentralized learning mechanism that combines transfer and
federated machine learning concepts using smart contracts, allowing data to
remain on users' devices and enabling effective tracking of mental health
conditions for psychiatric treatment and management in a privacy-aware and
accountable manner. We evaluate our model using a popular mental health dataset
that demonstrates promising results. By utilizing connected health systems and
machine learning models, our approach offers a novel solution to the challenge
of providing psychiatrists with further insight into their patients' mental
health outside of traditional office visits.

    <title>Interpretable Survival Analysis for Heart Failure Risk Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis, or time-to-event analysis, is an important and widespread
problem in healthcare research. Medical research has traditionally relied on
Cox models for survival analysis, due to their simplicity and interpretability.
Cox models assume a log-linear hazard function as well as proportional hazards
over time, and can perform poorly when these assumptions fail. Newer survival
models based on machine learning avoid these assumptions and offer improved
accuracy, yet sometimes at the expense of model interpretability, which is
vital for clinical use. We propose a novel survival analysis pipeline that is
both interpretable and competitive with state-of-the-art survival models.
Specifically, we use an improved version of survival stacking to transform a
survival analysis problem to a classification problem, ControlBurn to perform
feature selection, and Explainable Boosting Machines to generate interpretable
predictions. To evaluate our pipeline, we predict risk of heart failure using a
large-scale EHR database. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance
and provides interesting and novel insights about risk factors for heart
failure.

    <title>Decision-Focused Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Reward Transfer</title>
    <summary>  Decision-focused (DF) model-based reinforcement learning has recently been
introduced as a powerful algorithm that can focus on learning the MDP dynamics
that are most relevant for obtaining high returns. While this approach
increases the agent's performance by directly optimizing the reward, it does so
by learning less accurate dynamics from a maximum likelihood perspective. We
demonstrate that when the reward function is defined by preferences over
multiple objectives, the DF model may be sensitive to changes in the objective
preferences.In this work, we develop the robust decision-focused (RDF)
algorithm, which leverages the non-identifiability of DF solutions to learn
models that maximize expected returns while simultaneously learning models that
transfer to changes in the preference over multiple objectives. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of RDF on two synthetic domains and two healthcare
simulators, showing that it significantly improves the robustness of DF model
learning to changes in the reward function without compromising training-time
return.

    <title>Assuring the Machine Learning Lifecycle: Desiderata, Methods, and
  Challenges</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning has evolved into an enabling technology for a wide range of
highly successful applications. The potential for this success to continue and
accelerate has placed machine learning (ML) at the top of research, economic
and political agendas. Such unprecedented interest is fuelled by a vision of ML
applicability extending to healthcare, transportation, defence and other
domains of great societal importance. Achieving this vision requires the use of
ML in safety-critical applications that demand levels of assurance beyond those
needed for current ML applications. Our paper provides a comprehensive survey
of the state-of-the-art in the assurance of ML, i.e. in the generation of
evidence that ML is sufficiently safe for its intended use. The survey covers
the methods capable of providing such evidence at different stages of the
machine learning lifecycle, i.e. of the complex, iterative process that starts
with the collection of the data used to train an ML component for a system, and
ends with the deployment of that component within the system. The paper begins
with a systematic presentation of the ML lifecycle and its stages. We then
define assurance desiderata for each stage, review existing methods that
contribute to achieving these desiderata, and identify open challenges that
require further research.

    <title>Learn to Intervene: An Adaptive Learning Policy for Restless Bandits in
  Application to Preventive Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In many public health settings, it is important for patients to adhere to
health programs, such as taking medications and periodic health checks.
Unfortunately, beneficiaries may gradually disengage from such programs, which
is detrimental to their health. A concrete example of gradual disengagement has
been observed by an organization that carries out a free automated call-based
program for spreading preventive care information among pregnant women. Many
women stop picking up calls after being enrolled for a few months. To avoid
such disengagements, it is important to provide timely interventions. Such
interventions are often expensive and can be provided to only a small fraction
of the beneficiaries. We model this scenario as a restless multi-armed bandit
(RMAB) problem, where each beneficiary is assumed to transition from one state
to another depending on the intervention. Moreover, since the transition
probabilities are unknown a priori, we propose a Whittle index based Q-Learning
mechanism and show that it converges to the optimal solution. Our method
improves over existing learning-based methods for RMABs on multiple benchmarks
from literature and also on the maternal healthcare dataset.

    <title>Transfer Learning in 4D for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Dynamic
  Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
    <summary>  Deep transfer learning using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) has shown strong predictive power in characterization of
breast lesions. However, pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
require 2D inputs, limiting the ability to exploit the rich 4D (volumetric and
temporal) image information inherent in DCE-MRI that is clinically valuable for
lesion assessment. Training 3D CNNs from scratch, a common method to utilize
high-dimensional information in medical images, is computationally expensive
and is not best suited for moderately sized healthcare datasets. Therefore, we
propose a novel approach using transfer learning that incorporates the 4D
information from DCE-MRI, where volumetric information is collapsed at feature
level by max pooling along the projection perpendicular to the transverse
slices and the temporal information is contained either in second-post contrast
subtraction images. Our methodology yielded an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of 0.89+/-0.01 on a dataset of 1161 breast
lesions, significantly outperforming a previous approach that incorporates the
4D information in DCE-MRI by the use of maximum intensity projection (MIP)
images.

    <title>BI-RADS-Net: An Explainable Multitask Learning Approach for Cancer
  Diagnosis in Breast Ultrasound Images</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare, it is essential to explain the decision-making process of
machine learning models to establish the trustworthiness of clinicians. This
paper introduces BI-RADS-Net, a novel explainable deep learning approach for
cancer detection in breast ultrasound images. The proposed approach
incorporates tasks for explaining and classifying breast tumors, by learning
feature representations relevant to clinical diagnosis. Explanations of the
predictions (benign or malignant) are provided in terms of morphological
features that are used by clinicians for diagnosis and reporting in medical
practice. The employed features include the BI-RADS descriptors of shape,
orientation, margin, echo pattern, and posterior features. Additionally, our
approach predicts the likelihood of malignancy of the findings, which relates
to the BI-RADS assessment category reported by clinicians. Experimental
validation on a dataset consisting of 1,192 images indicates improved model
accuracy, supported by explanations in clinical terms using the BI-RADS
lexicon.

    <title>Sample Selection Bias in Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine,
their clinical adoption remains limited. One critical factor contributing to
this restraint is sample selection bias (SSB) which refers to the study
population being less representative of the target population, leading to
biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the
literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare.
Moreover, the existing techniques try to correct the bias by balancing
distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in
a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study
illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact
on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose
a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population
identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two
independent networks (T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing
SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is
representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the
identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the
performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the
study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for
the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the
non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed
techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different
dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing
bias correction techniques.

    <title>A Method for Medical Data Analysis Using the LogNNet for Clinical
  Decision Support Systems and Edge Computing in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Edge computing is a fast-growing and much needed technology in healthcare.
The problem of implementing artificial intelligence on edge devices is the
complexity and high resource intensity of the most known neural network data
analysis methods and algorithms. The difficulty of implementing these methods
on low-power microcontrollers with small memory size calls for the development
of new effective algorithms for neural networks. This study presents a new
method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which
uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The method effectively
solves classification problems and calculates risk factors for the presence of
a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The
efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on
cardiotocogram data obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
The classification accuracy reaches ~91% with the ~3-10 kB of RAM used on the
Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly
available database of the Israeli Ministry of Health, a service concept for
COVID-19 express testing is provided. A classification accuracy of ~95% is
achieved, and ~0.6 kB of RAM is used. In all examples, the model is tested
using standard classification quality metrics: precision, recall, and
F1-measure. The LogNNet architecture allows the implementation of artificial
intelligence on medical peripherals of the Internet of Things with low RAM
resources and can be used in clinical decision support systems.

    <title>Achieving Data Utility-Privacy Tradeoff in Internet of Medical Things: A
  Machine Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  The emergence and rapid development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT),
an application of the Internet of Things into the medical and healthcare
systems, have brought many changes and challenges to modern medical and
healthcare systems. Particularly, machine learning technology can be used to
process the data involved in IoMT for medical analysis and disease diagnosis.
However, in this process, the disclosure of personal privacy information must
receive considerable attentions especially for sensitive medical data. Cluster
analysis is an important technique for medical analysis and disease diagnosis.
To enable privacy-preserving cluster analysis in IoMT, this paper proposed an
Efficient Differentially Private Data Clustering scheme (EDPDCS) based on
MapReduce framework. In EDPDCS, we optimize the allocation of privacy budgets
and the selection of initial centroids to improve the accuracy of
differentially private K-means clustering algorithm. Specifically, the number
of iterations of the K-means algorithm is set to a fixed value according to the
total privacy budget and the minimal privacy budget of each iteration. In
addition, an improved initial centroids selection method is proposed to
increase the accuracy and efficiency of the clustering algorithm. Finally, we
prove that the proposed EDPDCS can improve the accuracy of the differentially
private k-means algorithm by comparing the Normalized Intra-Cluster Variance
(NICV) produced by our algorithm on two datasets with two other algorithms.

    <title>Consensus-based Interpretable Deep Neural Networks with Application to
  Mortality Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various challenging
tasks. However, the black-box nature of such networks is not acceptable to
critical applications, such as healthcare. In particular, the existence of
adversarial examples and their overgeneralization to irrelevant,
out-of-distribution inputs with high confidence makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to explain decisions by such networks. In this paper, we analyze
the underlying mechanism of generalization of deep neural networks and propose
an ($n$, $k$) consensus algorithm which is insensitive to adversarial examples
and can reliably reject out-of-distribution samples. Furthermore, the consensus
algorithm is able to improve classification accuracy by using multiple trained
deep neural networks. To handle the complexity of deep neural networks, we
cluster linear approximations of individual models and identify highly
correlated clusters among different models to capture feature importance
robustly, resulting in improved interpretability. Motivated by the importance
of building accurate and interpretable prediction models for healthcare, our
experimental results on an ICU dataset show the effectiveness of our algorithm
in enhancing both the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of deep
neural network models on one-year patient mortality prediction. In particular,
while the proposed method maintains similar interpretability as conventional
shallow models such as logistic regression, it improves the prediction accuracy
significantly.

    <title>Review on the Security Threats of Internet of Things</title>
    <summary>  Internet of Things (IoT) is being considered as the growth engine for
industrial revolution 4.0. The combination of IoT, cloud computing and
healthcare can contribute in ensuring well-being of people. One important
challenge of IoT network is maintaining privacy and to overcome security
threats. This paper provides a systematic review of the security aspects of
IoT. Firstly, the application of IoT in industrial and medical service
scenarios are described, and the security threats are discussed for the
different layers of IoT healthcare architecture. Secondly, different types of
existing malware including spyware, viruses, worms, keyloggers, and trojan
horses are described in the context of IoT. Thirdly, some of the recent malware
attacks such as Mirai, echobot and reaper are discussed. Next, a comparative
discussion is presented on the effectiveness of different machine learning
algorithms in mitigating the security threats. It is found that the k-nearest
neighbor (kNN) machine learning algorithm exhibits excellent accuracy in
detecting malware. This paper also reviews different tools for ransomware
detection, classification and analysis. Finally, a discussion is presented on
the existing security issues, open challenges and possible future scopes in
ensuring IoT security.

    <title>Conformal Prediction with Temporal Quantile Adjustments</title>
    <summary>  We develop Temporal Quantile Adjustment (TQA), a general method to construct
efficient and valid prediction intervals (PIs) for regression on
cross-sectional time series data. Such data is common in many domains,
including econometrics and healthcare. A canonical example in healthcare is
predicting patient outcomes using physiological time-series data, where a
population of patients composes a cross-section. Reliable PI estimators in this
setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage
across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal
dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal
Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles
both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a
pre-specified quantile from the distribution of nonconformity scores on a
calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time $t$,
accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a
theoretically-grounded manner. The post-hoc nature of TQA facilitates its use
as a general wrapper around any time series regression model. We validate TQA's
performance through extensive experimentation: TQA generally obtains efficient
PIs and improves longitudinal coverage while preserving cross-sectional
coverage.

    <title>Internet of Things (IoT) based ECG System for Rural Health Care</title>
    <summary>  Nearly 30% of the people in the rural areas of Bangladesh are below the
poverty level. Moreover, due to the unavailability of modernized
healthcare-related technology, nursing and diagnosis facilities are limited for
rural people. Therefore, rural people are deprived of proper healthcare. In
this perspective, modern technology can be facilitated to mitigate their health
problems. ECG sensing tools are interfaced with the human chest, and requisite
cardiovascular data is collected through an IoT device. These data are stored
in the cloud incorporates with the MQTT and HTTP servers. An innovative
IoT-based method for ECG monitoring systems on cardiovascular or heart patients
has been suggested in this study. The ECG signal parameters P, Q, R, S, T are
collected, pre-processed, and predicted to monitor the cardiovascular
conditions for further health management. The machine learning algorithm is
used to determine the significance of ECG signal parameters and error rate. The
logistic regression model fitted the better agreements between the train and
test data. The prediction has been performed to determine the variation of
PQRST quality and its suitability in the ECG Monitoring System. Considering the
values of quality parameters, satisfactory results are obtained. The proposed
IoT-based ECG system reduces the health care cost and complexity of
cardiovascular diseases in the future.

    <title>Towards Robust Off-Policy Evaluation via Human Inputs</title>
    <summary>  Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are crucial tools for evaluating policies
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often
infeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected
to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods
to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing
approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can
arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often
results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating
policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address
the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help
provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage
human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and
adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,
we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a
subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case
utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient
algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual
bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample
complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and
real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach
not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less
pessimistic policy evaluations.

    <title>G-CMP: Graph-enhanced Contextual Matrix Profile for unsupervised anomaly
  detection in sensor-based remote health monitoring</title>
    <summary>  Sensor-based remote health monitoring is used in industrial, urban and
healthcare settings to monitor ongoing operation of equipment and human health.
An important aim is to intervene early if anomalous events or adverse health is
detected. In the wild, these anomaly detection approaches are challenged by
noise, label scarcity, high dimensionality, explainability and wide variability
in operating environments. The Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP) is a
configurable 2-dimensional version of the Matrix Profile (MP) that uses the
distance matrix of all subsequences of a time series to discover patterns and
anomalies. The CMP is shown to enhance the effectiveness of the MP and other
SOTA methods at detecting, visualising and interpreting true anomalies in noisy
real world data from different domains. It excels at zooming out and
identifying temporal patterns at configurable time scales. However, the CMP
does not address cross-sensor information, and cannot scale to high dimensional
data. We propose a novel, self-supervised graph-based approach for temporal
anomaly detection that works on context graphs generated from the CMP distance
matrix. The learned graph embeddings encode the anomalous nature of a time
context. In addition, we evaluate other graph outlier algorithms for the same
task. Given our pipeline is modular, graph construction, generation of graph
embeddings, and pattern recognition logic can all be chosen based on the
specific pattern detection application. We verified the effectiveness of
graph-based anomaly detection and compared it with the CMP and 3 state-of-the
art methods on two real-world healthcare datasets with different anomalies. Our
proposed method demonstrated better recall, alert rate and generalisability.

    <title>Evaluating The Accuracy of Classification Algorithms for Detecting Heart
  Disease Risk</title>
    <summary>  The healthcare industry generates enormous amounts of complex clinical data
that make the prediction of disease detection a complicated process. In medical
informatics, making effective and efficient decisions is very important. Data
Mining (DM) techniques are mainly used to identify and extract hidden patterns
and interesting knowledge to diagnose and predict diseases in medical datasets.
Nowadays, heart disease is considered one of the most important problems in the
healthcare field. Therefore, early diagnosis leads to a reduction in deaths. DM
techniques have proven highly effective for predicting and diagnosing heart
diseases. This work utilizes the classification algorithms with a medical
dataset of heart disease; namely, J48, Random Forest, and Na\"ive Bayes to
discover the accuracy of their performance. We also examine the impact of the
feature selection method. A comparative and analysis study was performed to
determine the best technique using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis
(Weka) software, version 3.8.6. The performance of the utilized algorithms was
evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.
The importance of using classification techniques for heart disease diagnosis
has been highlighted. We also reduced the number of attributes in the dataset,
which showed a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. The results
indicate that the best algorithm for predicting heart disease was Random Forest
with an accuracy of 99.24%.

    <title>Self-supervision for health insurance claims data: a Covid-19 use case</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we modify and apply self-supervision techniques to the domain
of medical health insurance claims. We model patients' healthcare claims
history analogous to free-text narratives, and introduce pre-trained `prior
knowledge', later utilized for patient outcome predictions on a challenging
task: predicting Covid-19 hospitalization, given a patient's pre-Covid-19
insurance claims history. Results suggest that pre-training on insurance claims
not only produces better prediction performance, but, more importantly,
improves the model's `clinical trustworthiness' and model
stability/reliability.

    <title>Multi-layer Representation Learning for Medical Concepts</title>
    <summary>  Learning efficient representations for concepts has been proven to be an
important basis for many applications such as machine translation or document
classification. Proper representations of medical concepts such as diagnosis,
medication, procedure codes and visits will have broad applications in
healthcare analytics. However, in Electronic Health Records (EHR) the visit
sequences of patients include multiple concepts (diagnosis, procedure, and
medication codes) per visit. This structure provides two types of relational
information, namely sequential order of visits and co-occurrence of the codes
within each visit. In this work, we propose Med2Vec, which not only learns
distributed representations for both medical codes and visits from a large EHR
dataset with over 3 million visits, but also allows us to interpret the learned
representations confirmed positively by clinical experts. In the experiments,
Med2Vec displays significant improvement in key medical applications compared
to popular baselines such as Skip-gram, GloVe and stacked autoencoder, while
providing clinically meaningful interpretation.

    <title>Dropout Feature Ranking for Deep Learning Models</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of
domains. Unfortunately, DNNs are notorious for their non-interpretability, and
thus limit their applicability in hypothesis-driven domains such as biology and
healthcare. Moreover, in the resource-constraint setting, it is critical to
design tests relying on fewer more informative features leading to high
accuracy performance within reasonable budget. We aim to close this gap by
proposing a new general feature ranking method for deep learning. We show that
our simple yet effective method performs on par or compares favorably to eight
strawman, classical and deep-learning feature ranking methods in two
simulations and five very different datasets on tasks ranging from
classification to regression, in both static and time series scenarios. We also
illustrate the use of our method on a drug response dataset and show that it
identifies genes relevant to the drug-response.

    <title>Metareasoning in Modular Software Systems: On-the-Fly Configuration
  using Reinforcement Learning with Rich Contextual Representations</title>
    <summary>  Assemblies of modular subsystems are being pressed into service to perform
sensing, reasoning, and decision making in high-stakes, time-critical tasks in
such areas as transportation, healthcare, and industrial automation. We address
the opportunity to maximize the utility of an overall computing system by
employing reinforcement learning to guide the configuration of the set of
interacting modules that comprise the system. The challenge of doing
system-wide optimization is a combinatorial problem. Local attempts to boost
the performance of a specific module by modifying its configuration often leads
to losses in overall utility of the system's performance as the distribution of
inputs to downstream modules changes drastically. We present metareasoning
techniques which consider a rich representation of the input, monitor the state
of the entire pipeline, and adjust the configuration of modules on-the-fly so
as to maximize the utility of a system's operation. We show significant
improvement in both real-world and synthetic pipelines across a variety of
reinforcement learning techniques.

    <title>Enhancing Performance for Highly Imbalanced Medical Data via Data
  Regularization in a Federated Learning Setting</title>
    <summary>  The increased availability of medical data has significantly impacted
healthcare by enabling the application of machine / deep learning approaches in
various instances. However, medical datasets are usually small and scattered
across multiple providers, suffer from high class-imbalance, and are subject to
stringent data privacy constraints. In this paper, the application of a data
regularization algorithm, suitable for learning under high class-imbalance, in
a federated learning setting is proposed. Specifically, the goal of the
proposed method is to enhance model performance for cardiovascular disease
prediction by tackling the class-imbalance that typically characterizes
datasets used for this purpose, as well as by leveraging patient data available
in different nodes of a federated ecosystem without compromising their privacy
and enabling more resource sensitive allocation. The method is evaluated across
four datasets for cardiovascular disease prediction, which are scattered across
different clients, achieving improved performance. Meanwhile, its robustness
under various hyperparameter settings, as well as its ability to adapt to
different resource allocation scenarios, is verified.

    <title>Solving inverse problems with deep neural networks driven by sparse
  signal decomposition in a physics-based dictionary</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNN) have an impressive ability to invert very complex
models, i.e. to learn the generative parameters from a model's output. Once
trained, the forward pass of a DNN is often much faster than traditional,
optimization-based methods used to solve inverse problems. This is however done
at the cost of lower interpretability, a fundamental limitation in most medical
applications. We propose an approach for solving general inverse problems which
combines the efficiency of DNN and the interpretability of traditional
analytical methods. The measurements are first projected onto a dense
dictionary of model-based responses. The resulting sparse representation is
then fed to a DNN with an architecture driven by the problem's physics for fast
parameter learning. Our method can handle generative forward models that are
costly to evaluate and exhibits similar performance in accuracy and computation
time as a fully-learned DNN, while maintaining high interpretability and being
easier to train. Concrete results are shown on an example of model-based brain
parameter estimation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

    <title>MissDiff: Training Diffusion Models on Tabular Data with Missing Values</title>
    <summary>  The diffusion model has shown remarkable performance in modeling data
distributions and synthesizing data. However, the vanilla diffusion model
requires complete or fully observed data for training. Incomplete data is a
common issue in various real-world applications, including healthcare and
finance, particularly when dealing with tabular datasets. This work presents a
unified and principled diffusion-based framework for learning from data with
missing values under various missing mechanisms. We first observe that the
widely adopted "impute-then-generate" pipeline may lead to a biased learning
objective. Then we propose to mask the regression loss of Denoising Score
Matching in the training phase. We prove the proposed method is consistent in
learning the score of data distributions, and the proposed training objective
serves as an upper bound for the negative likelihood in certain cases. The
proposed framework is evaluated on multiple tabular datasets using realistic
and efficacious metrics and is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art
diffusion model on tabular data with "impute-then-generate" pipeline by a large
margin.

    <title>Prediction of Malignant &amp; Benign Breast Cancer: A Data Mining Approach
  in Healthcare Applications</title>
    <summary>  As much as data science is playing a pivotal role everywhere, healthcare also
finds it prominent application. Breast Cancer is the top rated type of cancer
amongst women; which took away 627,000 lives alone. This high mortality rate
due to breast cancer does need attention, for early detection so that
prevention can be done in time. As a potential contributor to state-of-art
technology development, data mining finds a multi-fold application in
predicting Brest cancer. This work focuses on different classification
techniques implementation for data mining in predicting malignant and benign
breast cancer. Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set from the UCI repository has
been used as experimental dataset while attribute clump thickness being used as
an evaluation class. The performances of these twelve algorithms: Ada Boost M
1, Decision Table, J Rip, Lazy IBK, Logistics Regression, Multiclass
Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random forest and Random Tree
are analyzed on this data set. Keywords- Data Mining, Classification

    <title>Text2Node: a Cross-Domain System for Mapping Arbitrary Phrases to a
  Taxonomy</title>
    <summary>  Electronic health record (EHR) systems are used extensively throughout the
healthcare domain. However, data interchangeability between EHR systems is
limited due to the use of different coding standards across systems. Existing
methods of mapping coding standards based on manual human experts mapping,
dictionary mapping, symbolic NLP and classification are unscalable and cannot
accommodate large scale EHR datasets.
  In this work, we present Text2Node, a cross-domain mapping system capable of
mapping medical phrases to concepts in a large taxonomy (such as SNOMED CT).
The system is designed to generalize from a limited set of training samples and
map phrases to elements of the taxonomy that are not covered by training data.
As a result, our system is scalable, robust to wording variants between coding
systems and can output highly relevant concepts when no exact concept exists in
the target taxonomy. Text2Node operates in three main stages: first, the
lexicon is mapped to word embeddings; second, the taxonomy is vectorized using
node embeddings; and finally, the mapping function is trained to connect the
two embedding spaces. We compared multiple algorithms and architectures for
each stage of the training, including GloVe and FastText word embeddings, CNN
and Bi-LSTM mapping functions, and node2vec for node embeddings. We confirmed
the robustness and generalisation properties of Text2Node by mapping ICD-9-CM
Diagnosis phrases to SNOMED CT and by zero-shot training at comparable
accuracy.
  This system is a novel methodological contribution to the task of normalizing
and linking phrases to a taxonomy, advancing data interchangeability in
healthcare. When applied, the system can use electronic health records to
generate an embedding that incorporates taxonomical medical knowledge to
improve clinical predictive models.

    <title>Collapsing Bandits and Their Application to Public Health Interventions</title>
    <summary>  We propose and study Collpasing Bandits, a new restless multi-armed bandit
(RMAB) setting in which each arm follows a binary-state Markovian process with
a special structure: when an arm is played, the state is fully observed, thus
"collapsing" any uncertainty, but when an arm is passive, no observation is
made, thus allowing uncertainty to evolve. The goal is to keep as many arms in
the "good" state as possible by planning a limited budget of actions per round.
Such Collapsing Bandits are natural models for many healthcare domains in which
workers must simultaneously monitor patients and deliver interventions in a way
that maximizes the health of their patient cohort. Our main contributions are
as follows: (i) Building on the Whittle index technique for RMABs, we derive
conditions under which the Collapsing Bandits problem is indexable. Our
derivation hinges on novel conditions that characterize when the optimal
policies may take the form of either "forward" or "reverse" threshold policies.
(ii) We exploit the optimality of threshold policies to build fast algorithms
for computing the Whittle index, including a closed-form. (iii) We evaluate our
algorithm on several data distributions including data from a real-world
healthcare task in which a worker must monitor and deliver interventions to
maximize their patients' adherence to tuberculosis medication. Our algorithm
achieves a 3-order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art RMAB
techniques while achieving similar performance.

    <title>A Human-Centric Take on Model Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  Predictive models are increasingly used to make various consequential
decisions in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and policy. It
becomes critical to ensure that these models make accurate predictions, are
robust to shifts in the data, do not rely on spurious features, and do not
unduly discriminate against minority groups. To this end, several approaches
spanning various areas such as explainability, fairness, and robustness have
been proposed in recent literature. Such approaches need to be human-centered
as they cater to the understanding of the models to their users. However, there
is a research gap in understanding the human-centric needs and challenges of
monitoring machine learning (ML) models once they are deployed. To fill this
gap, we conducted an interview study with 13 practitioners who have experience
at the intersection of deploying ML models and engaging with customers spanning
domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, online retail,
computational advertising, and conversational assistants. We identified various
human-centric challenges and requirements for model monitoring in real-world
applications. Specifically, we found the need and the challenge for the model
monitoring systems to clarify the impact of the monitoring observations on
outcomes. Further, such insights must be actionable, robust, customizable for
domain-specific use cases, and cognitively considerate to avoid information
overload.

    <title>The effect of data augmentation and 3D-CNN depth on Alzheimer's Disease
  detection</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in healthcare,
outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.

    <title>Momentum Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest
  CT Images</title>
    <summary>  The current pandemic, caused by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) in December 2019, has led to a global emergency that has
significantly impacted economies, healthcare systems and personal wellbeing all
around the world. Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly
sensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly
used, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from
healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and
automatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising
direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient
training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this
end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of
COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use
contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature
representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the
prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the
proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly
available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the
superior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based
on chest CT images.

    <title>Ensembling Neural Networks for Improved Prediction and Privacy in Early
  Diagnosis of Sepsis</title>
    <summary>  Ensembling neural networks is a long-standing technique for improving the
generalization error of neural networks by combining networks with orthogonal
properties via a committee decision. We show that this technique is an ideal
fit for machine learning on medical data: First, ensembles are amenable to
parallel and asynchronous learning, thus enabling efficient training of
patient-specific component neural networks. Second, building on the idea of
minimizing generalization error by selecting uncorrelated patient-specific
networks, we show that one can build an ensemble of a few selected
patient-specific models that outperforms a single model trained on much larger
pooled datasets. Third, the non-iterative ensemble combination step is an
optimal low-dimensional entry point to apply output perturbation to guarantee
the privacy of the patient-specific networks. We exemplify our framework of
differentially private ensembles on the task of early prediction of sepsis,
using real-life intensive care unit data labeled by clinical experts.

    <title>Multi-Task Gaussian Processes and Dilated Convolutional Networks for
  Reconstruction of Reproductive Hormonal Dynamics</title>
    <summary>  We present an end-to-end statistical framework for personalized, accurate,
and minimally invasive modeling of female reproductive hormonal patterns.
Reconstructing and forecasting the evolution of hormonal dynamics is a
challenging task, but a critical one to improve general understanding of the
menstrual cycle and personalized detection of potential health issues. Our goal
is to infer and forecast individual hormone daily levels over time, while
accommodating pragmatic and minimally invasive measurement settings. To that
end, our approach combines the power of probabilistic generative models (i.e.,
multi-task Gaussian processes) with the flexibility of neural networks (i.e., a
dilated convolutional architecture) to learn complex temporal mappings. To
attain accurate hormone level reconstruction with as little data as possible,
we propose a sampling mechanism for optimal reconstruction accuracy with
limited sampling budget. Our results show the validity of our proposed hormonal
dynamic modeling framework, as it provides accurate predictive performance
across different realistic sampling budgets and outperforms baselines methods.

    <title>Time Aggregation and Model Interpretation for Deep Multivariate
  Longitudinal Patient Outcome Forecasting Systems in Chronic Ambulatory Care</title>
    <summary>  Clinical data for ambulatory care, which accounts for 90% of the nations
healthcare spending, is characterized by relatively small sample sizes of
longitudinal data, unequal spacing between visits for each patient, with
unequal numbers of data points collected across patients. While deep learning
has become state-of-the-art for sequence modeling, it is unknown which methods
of time aggregation may be best suited for these challenging temporal use
cases. Additionally, deep models are often considered uninterpretable by
physicians which may prevent the clinical adoption, even of well performing
models. We show that time-distributed-dense layers combined with GRUs produce
the most generalizable models. Furthermore, we provide a framework for the
clinical interpretation of the models.

    <title>Position paper: a general framework for applying machine learning
  techniques in operating room</title>
    <summary>  In this position paper we describe a general framework for applying machine
learning and pattern recognition techniques in healthcare. In particular, we
are interested in providing an automated tool for monitoring and incrementing
the level of awareness in the operating room and for identifying human errors
which occur during the laparoscopy surgical operation. The framework that we
present is divided in three different layers: each layer implements algorithms
which have an increasing level of complexity and which perform functionality
with an higher degree of abstraction. In the first layer, raw data collected
from sensors in the operating room during surgical operation, they are
pre-processed and aggregated. The results of this initial phase are transferred
to a second layer, which implements pattern recognition techniques and extract
relevant features from the data. Finally, in the last layer, expert systems are
employed to take high level decisions, which represent the final output of the
system.

    <title>U-PASS: an Uncertainty-guided deep learning Pipeline for Automated Sleep
  Staging</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning becomes increasingly prevalent in critical fields such as
healthcare, ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems
becomes paramount. A key component of reliability is the ability to estimate
uncertainty, which enables the identification of areas of high and low
confidence and helps to minimize the risk of error. In this study, we propose a
machine learning pipeline called U-PASS tailored for clinical applications that
incorporates uncertainty estimation at every stage of the process, including
data acquisition, training, and model deployment. The training process is
divided into a supervised pre-training step and a semi-supervised finetuning
step. We apply our uncertainty-guided deep learning pipeline to the challenging
problem of sleep staging and demonstrate that it systematically improves
performance at every stage. By optimizing the training dataset, actively
seeking informative samples, and deferring the most uncertain samples to an
expert, we achieve an expert-level accuracy of 85% on a challenging clinical
dataset of elderly sleep apnea patients, representing a significant improvement
over the baseline accuracy of 75%. U-PASS represents a promising approach to
incorporating uncertainty estimation into machine learning pipelines, thereby
improving their reliability and unlocking their potential in clinical settings.

    <title>A Deep Learning Pipeline for Patient Diagnosis Prediction Using
  Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Augmentation of disease diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare with
machine learning algorithms is gaining much impetus in recent years. In
particular, in the current epidemiological situation caused by COVID-19
pandemic, swift and accurate prediction of disease diagnosis with machine
learning algorithms could facilitate identification and care of vulnerable
clusters of population, such as those having multi-morbidity conditions. In
order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in
both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are
imperative. First, with respect to data collection and representation, we face
severe problems due to multitude of formats and lack of coherency prevalent in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This causes hindrance in extraction of
valuable information contained in EHRs. Currently, no universal global data
standard has been established. As a useful solution, we develop and publish a
Python package to transform public health dataset into an easy to access
universal format. This data transformation to an international health data
format facilitates researchers to easily combine EHR datasets with clinical
datasets of diverse formats. Second, machine learning algorithms that predict
multiple disease diagnosis categories simultaneously remain underdeveloped. We
propose two novel model architectures in this regard. First, DeepObserver,
which uses structured numerical data to predict the diagnosis categories and
second, ClinicalBERT_Multi, that incorporates rich information available in
clinical notes via natural language processing methods and also provides
interpretable visualizations to medical practitioners. We show that both models
can predict multiple diagnoses simultaneously with high accuracy.

    <title>Generalized Linear Models for Aggregated Data</title>
    <summary>  Databases in domains such as healthcare are routinely released to the public
in aggregated form. Unfortunately, naive modeling with aggregated data may
significantly diminish the accuracy of inferences at the individual level. This
paper addresses the scenario where features are provided at the individual
level, but the target variables are only available as histogram aggregates or
order statistics. We consider a limiting case of generalized linear modeling
when the target variables are only known up to permutation, and explore how
this relates to permutation testing; a standard technique for assessing
statistical dependency. Based on this relationship, we propose a simple
algorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level inferences via
alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting. Our
results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in the
original data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of the
linear relationship. The framework is extended to general histogram data with
larger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Our
experimental results on simulated data and aggregated healthcare data suggest a
diminishing returns property with respect to the granularity of the histogram -
when a linear relationship holds in the original data, the targets can be
predicted accurately given relatively coarse histograms.

    <title>Learning Patterns in Imaginary Vowels for an Intelligent Brain Computer
  Interface (BCI) Design</title>
    <summary>  Technology advancements made it easy to measure non-invasive and high-quality
electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from human's brain. Hence, development of
robust and high-performance AI algorithms becomes crucial to properly process
the EEG signals and recognize the patterns, which lead to an appropriate
control signal. Despite the advancements in processing the motor imagery EEG
signals, the healthcare applications, such as emotion detection, are still in
the early stages of AI design. In this paper, we propose a modular framework
for the recognition of vowels as the AI part of a brain computer interface
system. We carefully designed the modules to discriminate the English vowels
given the raw EEG signals, and meanwhile avoid the typical issued with the
data-poor environments like most of the healthcare applications. The proposed
framework consists of appropriate signal segmentation, filtering, extraction of
spectral features, reducing the dimensions by means of principle component
analysis, and finally a multi-class classification by decision-tree-based
support vector machine (DT-SVM). The performance of our framework was evaluated
by a combination of test-set and resubstitution (also known as apparent) error
rates. We provide the algorithms of the proposed framework to make it easy for
future researchers and developers who want to follow the same workflow.

    <title>Assessing the communication gap between AI models and healthcare
  professionals: explainability, utility and trust in AI-driven clinical
  decision-making</title>
    <summary>  This paper contributes with a pragmatic evaluation framework for explainable
Machine Learning (ML) models for clinical decision support. The study revealed
a more nuanced role for ML explanation models, when these are pragmatically
embedded in the clinical context. Despite the general positive attitude of
healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards explanations as a safety and trust
mechanism, for a significant set of participants there were negative effects
associated with confirmation bias, accentuating model over-reliance and
increased effort to interact with the model. Also, contradicting one of its
main intended functions, standard explanatory models showed limited ability to
support a critical understanding of the limitations of the model. However, we
found new significant positive effects which repositions the role of
explanations within a clinical context: these include reduction of automation
bias, addressing ambiguous clinical cases (cases where HCPs were not certain
about their decision) and support of less experienced HCPs in the acquisition
of new domain knowledge.

    <title>Learning Representations for Counterfactual Inference</title>
    <summary>  Observational studies are rising in importance due to the widespread
accumulation of data in fields such as healthcare, education, employment and
ecology. We consider the task of answering counterfactual questions such as,
"Would this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different
medication?". We propose a new algorithmic framework for counterfactual
inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation and representation
learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform an empirical
comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational
data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art.

    <title>Towards Interpretable Deep Neural Networks by Leveraging Adversarial
  Examples</title>
    <summary>  Sometimes it is not enough for a DNN to produce an outcome. For example, in
applications such as healthcare, users need to understand the rationale of the
decisions. Therefore, it is imperative to develop algorithms to learn models
with good interpretability (Doshi-Velez 2017). An important factor that leads
to the lack of interpretability of DNNs is the ambiguity of neurons, where a
neuron may fire for various unrelated concepts. This work aims to increase the
interpretability of DNNs on the whole image space by reducing the ambiguity of
neurons. In this paper, we make the following contributions:
  1) We propose a metric to evaluate the consistency level of neurons in a
network quantitatively.
  2) We find that the learned features of neurons are ambiguous by leveraging
adversarial examples.
  3) We propose to improve the consistency of neurons on adversarial example
subset by an adversarial training algorithm with a consistent loss.

    <title>Cluster-Based Social Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Social Reinforcement Learning methods, which model agents in large networks,
are useful for fake news mitigation, personalized teaching/healthcare, and
viral marketing, but it is challenging to incorporate inter-agent dependencies
into the models effectively due to network size and sparse interaction data.
Previous social RL approaches either ignore agents dependencies or model them
in a computationally intensive manner. In this work, we incorporate agent
dependencies efficiently in a compact model by clustering users (based on their
payoff and contribution to the goal) and combine this with a method to easily
derive personalized agent-level policies from cluster-level policies. We also
propose a dynamic clustering approach that captures changing user behavior.
Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate that our proposed approach learns
more accurate policy estimates and converges more quickly, compared to several
baselines that do not use agent correlations or only use static clusters.

    <title>NODE-GAM: Neural Generalized Additive Model for Interpretable Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deployment of machine learning models in real high-risk settings (e.g.
healthcare) often depends not only on the model's accuracy but also on its
fairness, robustness, and interpretability. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
are a class of interpretable models with a long history of use in these
high-risk domains, but they lack desirable features of deep learning such as
differentiability and scalability. In this work, we propose a neural GAM
(NODE-GAM) and neural GA$^2$M (NODE-GA$^2$M) that scale well and perform better
than other GAMs on large datasets, while remaining interpretable compared to
other ensemble and deep learning models. We demonstrate that our models find
interesting patterns in the data. Lastly, we show that we improve model
accuracy via self-supervised pre-training, an improvement that is not possible
for non-differentiable GAMs.

    <title>Federated Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Evidence-based or data-driven dynamic treatment regimes are essential for
personalized medicine, which can benefit from offline reinforcement learning
(RL). Although massive healthcare data are available across medical
institutions, they are prohibited from sharing due to privacy constraints.
Besides, heterogeneity exists in different sites. As a result, federated
offline RL algorithms are necessary and promising to deal with the problems. In
this paper, we propose a multi-site Markov decision process model that allows
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous effects across sites. The proposed model
makes the analysis of the site-level features possible. We design the first
federated policy optimization algorithm for offline RL with sample complexity.
The proposed algorithm is communication-efficient, which requires only a single
round of communication interaction by exchanging summary statistics. We give a
theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm, where the suboptimality for
the learned policies is comparable to the rate as if data is not distributed.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The method is applied to a sepsis dataset in multiple sites to illustrate its
use in clinical settings.

    <title>Framework Construction of an Adversarial Federated Transfer Learning
  Classifier</title>
    <summary>  As the Internet grows in popularity, more and more classification jobs, such
as IoT, finance industry and healthcare field, rely on mobile edge computing to
advance machine learning. In the medical industry, however, good diagnostic
accuracy necessitates the combination of large amounts of labeled data to train
the model, which is difficult and expensive to collect and risks jeopardizing
patients' privacy. In this paper, we offer a novel medical diagnostic framework
that employs a federated learning platform to ensure patient data privacy by
transferring classification algorithms acquired in a labeled domain to a domain
with sparse or missing labeled data. Rather than using a generative adversarial
network, our framework uses a discriminative model to build multiple
classification loss functions with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy.
It also avoids the difficulty of collecting large amounts of labeled data or
the high cost of generating large amount of sample data. Experiments on
real-world image datasets demonstrates that the suggested adversarial federated
transfer learning method is promising for real-world medical diagnosis
applications that use image classification.

    <title>Instability in clinical risk stratification models using deep learning</title>
    <summary>  While it has been well known in the ML community that deep learning models
suffer from instability, the consequences for healthcare deployments are under
characterised. We study the stability of different model architectures trained
on electronic health records, using a set of outpatient prediction tasks as a
case study. We show that repeated training runs of the same deep learning model
on the same training data can result in significantly different outcomes at a
patient level even though global performance metrics remain stable. We propose
two stability metrics for measuring the effect of randomness of model training,
as well as mitigation strategies for improving model stability.

    <title>Learning Fair Ranking Policies via Differentiable Optimization of
  Ordered Weighted Averages</title>
    <summary>  Learning to Rank (LTR) is one of the most widely used machine learning
applications. It is a key component in platforms with profound societal
impacts, including job search, healthcare information retrieval, and social
media content feeds. Conventional LTR models have been shown to produce biases
results, stimulating a discourse on how to address the disparities introduced
by ranking systems that solely prioritize user relevance. However, while
several models of fair learning to rank have been proposed, they suffer from
deficiencies either in accuracy or efficiency, thus limiting their
applicability to real-world ranking platforms. This paper shows how
efficiently-solvable fair ranking models, based on the optimization of Ordered
Weighted Average (OWA) functions, can be integrated into the training loop of
an LTR model to achieve favorable balances between fairness, user utility, and
runtime efficiency. In particular, this paper is the first to show how to
backpropagate through constrained optimizations of OWA objectives, enabling
their use in integrated prediction and decision models.

    <title>Connecting Fairness in Machine Learning with Public Health Equity</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) has become a critical tool in public health, offering
the potential to improve population health, diagnosis, treatment selection, and
health system efficiency. However, biases in data and model design can result
in disparities for certain protected groups and amplify existing inequalities
in healthcare. To address this challenge, this study summarizes seminal
literature on ML fairness and presents a framework for identifying and
mitigating biases in the data and model. The framework provides guidance on
incorporating fairness into different stages of the typical ML pipeline, such
as data processing, model design, deployment, and evaluation. To illustrate the
impact of biases in data on ML models, we present examples that demonstrate how
systematic biases can be amplified through model predictions. These case
studies suggest how the framework can be used to prevent these biases and
highlight the need for fair and equitable ML models in public health. This work
aims to inform and guide the use of ML in public health towards a more ethical
and equitable outcome for all populations.

    <title>Machine learning approaches in Detecting the Depression from
  Resting-state Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review Study</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we aimed at reviewing several different approaches present
today in the search for more accurate diagnostic and treatment management in
mental healthcare. Our focus is on mood disorders, and in particular on the
major depressive disorder (MDD). We are reviewing and discussing findings based
on neuroimaging studies (MRI and fMRI) first to get the impression of the body
of knowledge about the anatomical and functional differences in depression.
Then, we are focusing on less expensive data-driven approach, applicable for
everyday clinical practice, in particular, those based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Among those studies utilizing EEG, we
are discussing a group of applications used for detecting of depression based
on the resting state EEG (detection studies) and interventional studies (using
stimulus in their protocols or aiming to predict the outcome of therapy). We
conclude with a discussion and review of guidelines to improve the reliability
of developed models that could serve improvement of diagnostic of depression in
psychiatry.

    <title>Why model why? Assessing the strengths and limitations of LIME</title>
    <summary>  When it comes to complex machine learning models, commonly referred to as
black boxes, understanding the underlying decision making process is crucial
for domains such as healthcare and financial services, and also when it is used
in connection with safety critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. As such
interest in explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) tools and techniques has
increased in recent years. However, the effectiveness of existing xAI
frameworks, especially concerning algorithms that work with data as opposed to
images, is still an open research question. In order to address this gap, in
this paper we examine the effectiveness of the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) xAI framework, one of the most popular model
agnostic frameworks found in the literature, with a specific focus on its
performance in terms of making tabular models more interpretable. In
particular, we apply several state of the art machine learning algorithms on a
tabular dataset, and demonstrate how LIME can be used to supplement
conventional performance assessment methods. In addition, we evaluate the
understandability of the output produced by LIME both via a usability study,
involving participants who are not familiar with LIME, and its overall
usability via an assessment framework, which is derived from the International
Organisation for Standardisation 9241-11:1998 standard.

    <title>Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a proven and indispensable machine
learning tool. As a black-box model, it remains difficult to diagnose what
aspects of the model's input drive the decisions of a DNN. In countless
real-world domains, from legislation and law enforcement to healthcare, such
diagnosis is essential to ensure that DNN decisions are driven by aspects
appropriate in the context of its use. The development of methods and studies
enabling the explanation of a DNN's decisions has thus blossomed into an
active, broad area of research. A practitioner wanting to study explainable
deep learning may be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the
field has taken. This complexity is further exacerbated by competing
definitions of what it means ``to explain'' the actions of a DNN and to
evaluate an approach's ``ability to explain''. This article offers a field
guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning aimed at those
uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple
dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to
explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model
explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep
learning research areas, and iv) finally elaborates on user-oriented
explanation designing and potential future directions on explainable deep
learning. We hope the guide is used as an easy-to-digest starting point for
those just embarking on research in this field.

    <title>Applications of Distributed Machine Learning for the Internet-of-Things:
  A Comprehensive Survey</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of new services and applications in emerging wireless networks
(e.g., beyond 5G and 6G) has shown a growing demand for the usage of artificial
intelligence (AI) in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the proliferation
of massive IoT connections and the availability of computing resources
distributed across future IoT systems have strongly demanded the development of
distributed AI for better IoT services and applications. Therefore, existing
AI-enabled IoT systems can be enhanced by implementing distributed machine
learning (aka distributed learning) approaches. This work aims to provide a
comprehensive survey on distributed learning for IoT services and applications
in emerging networks. In particular, we first provide a background of machine
learning and present a preliminary to typical distributed learning approaches,
such as federated learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and distributed
inference. Then, we provide an extensive review of distributed learning for
critical IoT services (e.g., data sharing and computation offloading,
localization, mobile crowdsensing, and security and privacy) and IoT
applications (e.g., smart healthcare, smart grid, autonomous vehicle, aerial
IoT networks, and smart industry). From the reviewed literature, we also
present critical challenges of distributed learning for IoT and propose several
promising solutions and research directions in this emerging area.

    <title>Open Set Medical Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  Machine-learned diagnosis models have shown promise as medical aides but are
trained under a closed-set assumption, i.e. that models will only encounter
conditions on which they have been trained. However, it is practically
infeasible to obtain sufficient training data for every human condition, and
once deployed such models will invariably face previously unseen conditions. We
frame machine-learned diagnosis as an open-set learning problem, and study how
state-of-the-art approaches compare. Further, we extend our study to a setting
where training data is distributed across several healthcare sites that do not
allow data pooling, and experiment with different strategies of building
open-set diagnostic ensembles. Across both settings, we observe consistent
gains from explicitly modeling unseen conditions, but find the optimal training
strategy to vary across settings.

    <title>Explaining Deep Classification of Time-Series Data with Learned
  Prototypes</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of deep learning networks raises a need for explainable AI so
that users and domain experts can be confident applying them to high-risk
decisions. In this paper, we leverage data from the latent space induced by
deep learning models to learn stereotypical representations or "prototypes"
during training to elucidate the algorithmic decision-making process. We study
how leveraging prototypes effect classification decisions of two dimensional
time-series data in a few different settings: (1) electrocardiogram (ECG)
waveforms to detect clinical bradycardia, a slowing of heart rate, in preterm
infants, (2) respiration waveforms to detect apnea of prematurity, and (3)
audio waveforms to classify spoken digits. We improve upon existing models by
optimizing for increased prototype diversity and robustness, visualize how
these prototypes in the latent space are used by the model to distinguish
classes, and show that prototypes are capable of learning features on two
dimensional time-series data to produce explainable insights during
classification tasks. We show that the prototypes are capable of learning
real-world features - bradycardia in ECG, apnea in respiration, and
articulation in speech - as well as features within sub-classes. Our novel work
leverages learned prototypical framework on two dimensional time-series data to
produce explainable insights during classification tasks.

    <title>Assessing Social Determinants-Related Performance Bias of Machine
  Learning Models: A case of Hyperchloremia Prediction in ICU Population</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning in medicine leverages the wealth of healthcare data to
extract knowledge, facilitate clinical decision-making, and ultimately improve
care delivery. However, ML models trained on datasets that lack demographic
diversity could yield suboptimal performance when applied to the
underrepresented populations (e.g. ethnic minorities, lower social-economic
status), thus perpetuating health disparity. In this study, we evaluated four
classifiers built to predict Hyperchloremia - a condition that often results
from aggressive fluids administration in the ICU population - and compared
their performance in racial, gender, and insurance subgroups. We observed that
adding social determinants features in addition to the lab-based ones improved
model performance on all patients. The subgroup testing yielded significantly
different AUC scores in 40 out of the 44 model-subgroup, suggesting disparities
when applying ML models to social determinants subgroups. We urge future
researchers to design models that proactively adjust for potential biases and
include subgroup reporting in their studies.

    <title>Globalizing Fairness Attributes in Machine Learning: A Case Study on
  Health in Africa</title>
    <summary>  With growing machine learning (ML) applications in healthcare, there have
been calls for fairness in ML to understand and mitigate ethical concerns these
systems may pose. Fairness has implications for global health in Africa, which
already has inequitable power imbalances between the Global North and South.
This paper seeks to explore fairness for global health, with Africa as a case
study. We propose fairness attributes for consideration in the African context
and delineate where they may come into play in different ML-enabled medical
modalities. This work serves as a basis and call for action for furthering
research into fairness in global health.

    <title>ChatGPT-HealthPrompt. Harnessing the Power of XAI in Prompt-Based
  Healthcare Decision Support using ChatGPT</title>
    <summary>  This study presents an innovative approach to the application of large
language models (LLMs) in clinical decision-making, focusing on OpenAI's
ChatGPT. Our approach introduces the use of contextual prompts-strategically
designed to include task description, feature description, and crucially,
integration of domain knowledge-for high-quality binary classification tasks
even in data-scarce scenarios. The novelty of our work lies in the utilization
of domain knowledge, obtained from high-performing interpretable ML models, and
its seamless incorporation into prompt design. By viewing these ML models as
medical experts, we extract key insights on feature importance to aid in
decision-making processes. This interplay of domain knowledge and AI holds
significant promise in creating a more insightful diagnostic tool.
  Additionally, our research explores the dynamics of zero-shot and few-shot
prompt learning based on LLMs. By comparing the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT
with traditional supervised ML models in different data conditions, we aim to
provide insights into the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies under
varied data availability. In essence, this paper bridges the gap between AI and
healthcare, proposing a novel methodology for LLMs application in clinical
decision support systems. It highlights the transformative potential of
effective prompt design, domain knowledge integration, and flexible learning
approaches in enhancing automated decision-making.

    <title>Clairvoyance: A Pipeline Toolkit for Medical Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Time-series learning is the bread and butter of data-driven *clinical
decision support*, and the recent explosion in ML research has demonstrated
great potential in various healthcare settings. At the same time, medical
time-series problems in the wild are challenging due to their highly
*composite* nature: They entail design choices and interactions among
components that preprocess data, impute missing values, select features, issue
predictions, estimate uncertainty, and interpret models. Despite exponential
growth in electronic patient data, there is a remarkable gap between the
potential and realized utilization of ML for clinical research and decision
support. In particular, orchestrating a real-world project lifecycle poses
challenges in engineering (i.e. hard to build), evaluation (i.e. hard to
assess), and efficiency (i.e. hard to optimize). Designed to address these
issues simultaneously, Clairvoyance proposes a unified, end-to-end,
autoML-friendly pipeline that serves as a (i) software toolkit, (ii) empirical
standard, and (iii) interface for optimization. Our ultimate goal lies in
facilitating transparent and reproducible experimentation with complex
inference workflows, providing integrated pathways for (1) personalized
prediction, (2) treatment-effect estimation, and (3) information acquisition.
Through illustrative examples on real-world data in outpatient, general wards,
and intensive-care settings, we illustrate the applicability of the pipeline
paradigm on core tasks in the healthcare journey. To the best of our knowledge,
Clairvoyance is the first to demonstrate viability of a comprehensive and
automatable pipeline for clinical time-series ML.

    <title>Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Large-Scale Dynamic Bayesian Network
  Structure Learning</title>
    <summary>  Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), renowned for their interpretability, have
become increasingly vital in representing complex stochastic processes in
various domains such as gene expression analysis, healthcare, and traffic
prediction. Structure learning of DBNs from data is challenging, particularly
for datasets with thousands of variables. Most current algorithms for DBN
structure learning are adaptations from those used in static Bayesian Networks
(BNs), and are typically focused on small-scale problems. In order to solve
large-scale problems while taking full advantage of existing algorithms, this
paper introduces a novel divide-and-conquer strategy, originally developed for
static BNs, and adapts it for large-scale DBN structure learning. In this work,
we specifically concentrate on 2 Time-sliced Bayesian Networks (2-TBNs), a
special class of DBNs. Furthermore, we leverage the prior knowledge of 2-TBNs
to enhance the performance of the strategy we introduce. Our approach
significantly improves the scalability and accuracy of 2-TBN structure
learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
showing substantial improvements over existing algorithms in both computational
efficiency and structure learning accuracy. On problem instances with more than
1,000 variables, our approach improves two accuracy metrics by 74.45% and
110.94% on average , respectively, while reducing runtime by 93.65% on average.

    <title>DEUS: Distributed Electronic Patient File Update System</title>
    <summary>  Inadequate availability of patient information is a major cause for medical
errors and affects costs in healthcare. Traditional approaches to information
integration in healthcare do not solve the problem. Applying a
document-oriented paradigm to systems integration enables inter-institutional
information exchange in healthcare. The goal of the proposed architecture is to
provide information exchange between strict autonomous healthcare institutions,
bridging the gap between primary and secondary care. In a long-term healthcare
data distribution scenario, the patient has to maintain sovereignty over any
personal health information. Thus, the traditional publish-subscribe
architecture is extended by a phase of human mediation within the data flow.
DEUS essentially decouples the roles of information author and information
publisher into distinct actors, resulting in a triangular data flow. The
interaction scenario will be motivated. The significance of human mediation
will be discussed. DEUS provides a carefully distinguished actor and role model
for mediated pub-sub. The data flow between the participants is factored into
distinct phases of information interchange. The artefact model is decomposed
into role-dependent constituent parts. Both a domain specific (healthcare)
terminology and a generic terminology is provided. From a technical
perspective, the system design is presented. The sublayer for network transfer
will be highlighted as well as the subsystem for human-machine interaction.

    <title>Hospital Readmission Prediction - Applying Hierarchical Sparsity Norms
  for Interpretable Models</title>
    <summary>  Hospital readmissions have become one of the key measures of healthcare
quality. Preventable readmissions have been identified as one of the primary
targets for reducing costs and improving healthcare delivery. However, most
data driven studies for understanding readmissions have produced black box
classification and predictive models with moderate performance, which precludes
them from being used effectively within the decision support systems in the
hospitals. In this paper we present an application of structured
sparsity-inducing norms for predicting readmission risk for patients based on
their disease history and demographics. Most existing studies have focused on
hospital utilization, test results, etc., to assign a readmission label to each
episode of hospitalization. However, we focus on assigning a readmission risk
label to a patient based on their disease history. Our emphasis is on
interpreting the models to improve the understanding of the readmission
problem. To achieve this, we exploit the domain induced hierarchical structure
available for the disease codes which are the features for the classification
algorithm. We use a tree based sparsity-inducing regularization strategy that
explicitly uses the domain hierarchy. The resulting model not only outperforms
standard regularization procedures but is also highly sparse and interpretable.
We analyze the model and identify several significant factors that have an
effect on readmission risk. Some of these factors conform to existing beliefs,
e.g., impact of surgical complications and infections during hospital stay.
Other factors, such as the impact of mental disorder and substance abuse on
readmission, provide empirical evidence for several pre-existing but unverified
hypotheses. The analysis also reveals previously undiscovered connections such
as the influence of socioeconomic factors like lack of housing and
malnutrition.

    <title>Towards a Comprehensive Solution for a Vision-based Digitized
  Neurological Examination</title>
    <summary>  The ability to use digitally recorded and quantified neurological exam
information is important to help healthcare systems deliver better care,
in-person and via telehealth, as they compensate for a growing shortage of
neurologists. Current neurological digital biomarker pipelines, however, are
narrowed down to a specific neurological exam component or applied for
assessing specific conditions. In this paper, we propose an accessible
vision-based exam and documentation solution called Digitized Neurological
Examination (DNE) to expand exam biomarker recording options and clinical
applications using a smartphone/tablet. Through our DNE software, healthcare
providers in clinical settings and people at home are enabled to video capture
an examination while performing instructed neurological tests, including finger
tapping, finger to finger, forearm roll, and stand-up and walk. Our modular
design of the DNE software supports integrations of additional tests. The DNE
extracts from the recorded examinations the 2D/3D human-body pose and
quantifies kinematic and spatio-temporal features. The features are clinically
relevant and allow clinicians to document and observe the quantified movements
and the changes of these metrics over time. A web server and a user interface
for recordings viewing and feature visualizations are available. DNE was
evaluated on a collected dataset of 21 subjects containing normal and
simulated-impaired movements. The overall accuracy of DNE is demonstrated by
classifying the recorded movements using various machine learning models. Our
tests show an accuracy beyond 90% for upper-limb tests and 80% for the stand-up
and walk tests.

    <title>Self-Supervised Multimodal Learning: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from
multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime
in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive
human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability
of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has
become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building
on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides
ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a
comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate
three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal
data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2)
fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then
detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1)
objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision,
(2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion
strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and
fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML
algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine
translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML. A

    <title>Policy Certificates: Towards Accountable Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  The performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm can vary drastically
during learning because of exploration. Existing algorithms provide little
information about the quality of their current policy before executing it, and
thus have limited use in high-stakes applications like healthcare. We address
this lack of accountability by proposing that algorithms output policy
certificates. These certificates bound the sub-optimality and return of the
policy in the next episode, allowing humans to intervene when the certified
quality is not satisfactory. We further introduce two new algorithms with
certificates and present a new framework for theoretical analysis that
guarantees the quality of their policies and certificates. For tabular MDPs, we
show that computing certificates can even improve the sample-efficiency of
optimism-based exploration. As a result, one of our algorithms is the first to
achieve minimax-optimal PAC bounds up to lower-order terms, and this algorithm
also matches (and in some settings slightly improves upon) existing minimax
regret bounds.

    <title>Reliable Off-policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  In a sequential decision-making problem, off-policy evaluation estimates the
expected cumulative reward of a target policy using logged trajectory data
generated from a different behavior policy, without execution of the target
policy. Reinforcement learning in high-stake environments, such as healthcare
and education, is often limited to off-policy settings due to safety or ethical
concerns, or inability of exploration. Hence it is imperative to quantify the
uncertainty of the off-policy estimate before deployment of the target policy.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides robust and optimistic
cumulative reward estimates using one or multiple logged trajectories data.
Leveraging methodologies from distributionally robust optimization, we show
that with proper selection of the size of the distributional uncertainty set,
these estimates serve as confidence bounds with non-asymptotic and asymptotic
guarantees under stochastic or adversarial environments. Our results are also
generalized to batch reinforcement learning and are supported by empirical
analysis.

    <title>Model enhancement and personalization using weakly supervised learning
  for multi-modal mobile sensing</title>
    <summary>  Always-on sensing of mobile device user's contextual information is critical
to many intelligent use cases nowadays such as healthcare, drive assistance,
voice UI. State-of-the-art approaches for predicting user context have proved
the value to leverage multiple sensing modalities for better accuracy. However,
those context inference algorithms that run on application processor nowadays
tend to drain heavy amount of power, making them not suitable for an always-on
implementation. We claim that not every sensing modality is suitable to be
activated all the time and it remains challenging to build an inference engine
using power friendly sensing modalities. Meanwhile, due to the diverse
population, we find it challenging to learn a context inference model that
generalizes well, with limited training data, especially when only using
always-on low power sensors. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage
the opportunistically-on counterparts in device to improve the always-on
prediction model, leading to a personalized solution. We model this problem
using a weakly supervised learning framework and provide both theoretical and
experimental results to validate our design. The proposed framework achieves
satisfying result in the IMU based activity recognition application we
considered.

    <title>Interpretable Deep Learning for Automatic Diagnosis of 12-lead
  Electrocardiogram</title>
    <summary>  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used reliable, non-invasive approach for
cardiovascular disease diagnosis. With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and
the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG
signals has become a hot research topic. Deep learning methods have
demonstrated promising results in predictive healthcare tasks. In this paper,
we developed a deep neural network for multi-label classification of cardiac
arrhythmias in 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG
dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an
average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.970
and an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance
than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features.
Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance
than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I,
aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the model's behavior at both patient
level and population level. Our code is freely available at

    <title>Learning Clinical Concepts for Predicting Risk of Progression to Severe
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  With COVID-19 now pervasive, identification of high-risk individuals is
crucial. Using data from a major healthcare provider in Southwestern
Pennsylvania, we develop survival models predicting severe COVID-19
progression. In this endeavor, we face a tradeoff between more accurate models
relying on many features and less accurate models relying on a few features
aligned with clinician intuition. Complicating matters, many EHR features tend
to be under-coded, degrading the accuracy of smaller models. In this study, we
develop two sets of high-performance risk scores: (i) an unconstrained model
built from all available features; and (ii) a pipeline that learns a small set
of clinical concepts before training a risk predictor. Learned concepts boost
performance over the corresponding features (C-index 0.858 vs. 0.844) and
demonstrate improvements over (i) when evaluated out-of-sample (subsequent time
periods). Our models outperform previous works (C-index 0.844-0.872 vs.
0.598-0.810).

    <title>FedDAR: Federated Domain-Aware Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  Cross-silo Federated learning (FL) has become a promising tool in machine
learning applications for healthcare. It allows hospitals/institutions to train
models with sufficient data while the data is kept private. To make sure the FL
model is robust when facing heterogeneous data among FL clients, most efforts
focus on personalizing models for clients. However, the latent relationships
between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid
FL problem, called Domain-mixed FL, where each client's data distribution is
assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains. Recognizing the
diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel
method, FedDAR, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise
personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner. For simplified linear
regression settings, we have theoretically proved that FedDAR enjoys a linear
convergence rate. For general settings, we have performed intensive empirical
studies on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets which demonstrate its
superiority over prior FL methods.

    <title>Optimizing Audio Augmentations for Contrastive Learning of
  Health-Related Acoustic Signals</title>
    <summary>  Health-related acoustic signals, such as cough and breathing sounds, are
relevant for medical diagnosis and continuous health monitoring. Most existing
machine learning approaches for health acoustics are trained and evaluated on
specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various healthcare
applications. In this paper, we leverage a self-supervised learning framework,
SimCLR with a Slowfast NFNet backbone, for contrastive learning of health
acoustics. A crucial aspect of optimizing Slowfast NFNet for this application
lies in identifying effective audio augmentations. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of various audio augmentation strategies and demonstrate that an
appropriate augmentation strategy enhances the performance of the Slowfast
NFNet audio encoder across a diverse set of health acoustic tasks. Our findings
reveal that when augmentations are combined, they can produce synergistic
effects that exceed the benefits seen when each is applied individually.

    <title>An Interpretable Deep-Learning Framework for Predicting Hospital
  Readmissions From Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  With the increasing availability of patients' data, modern medicine is
shifting towards prospective healthcare. Electronic health records contain a
variety of information useful for clinical patient description and can be
exploited for the construction of predictive models, given that similar medical
histories will likely lead to similar progressions. One example is unplanned
hospital readmission prediction, an essential task for reducing hospital costs
and improving patient health. Despite predictive models showing very good
performances especially with deep-learning models, they are often criticized
for the poor interpretability of their results, a fundamental characteristic in
the medical field, where incorrect predictions might have serious consequences
for the patient health. In this paper we propose a novel, interpretable
deep-learning framework for predicting unplanned hospital readmissions,
supported by NLP findings on word embeddings and by neural-network models
(ConvLSTM) for better handling temporal data. We validate our system on the two
predictive tasks of hospital readmission within 30 and 180 days, using
real-world data. In addition, we introduce and test a model-dependent technique
to make the representation of results easily interpretable by the medical
staff. Our solution achieves better performances compared to traditional models
based on machine learning, while providing at the same time more interpretable
results.

    <title>Assessing Uncertainty Estimation Methods for 3D Image Segmentation under
  Distribution Shifts</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, machine learning has witnessed extensive adoption across
various sectors, yet its application in medical image-based disease detection
and diagnosis remains challenging due to distribution shifts in real-world
data. In practical settings, deployed models encounter samples that differ
significantly from the training dataset, especially in the health domain,
leading to potential performance issues. This limitation hinders the
expressiveness and reliability of deep learning models in health applications.
Thus, it becomes crucial to identify methods capable of producing reliable
uncertainty estimation in the context of distribution shifts in the health
sector. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using cutting-edge
Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods to detect distributionally shifted samples,
aiming to achieve reliable and trustworthy diagnostic predictions in
segmentation task. Specifically, we compare three distinct uncertainty
estimation methods, each designed to capture either unimodal or multimodal
aspects in the posterior distribution. Our findings demonstrate that methods
capable of addressing multimodal characteristics in the posterior distribution,
offer more dependable uncertainty estimates. This research contributes to
enhancing the utility of deep learning in healthcare, making diagnostic
predictions more robust and trustworthy.

    <title>Optimising Individual-Treatment-Effect Using Bandits</title>
    <summary>  Applying causal inference models in areas such as economics, healthcare and
marketing receives great interest from the machine learning community. In
particular, estimating the individual-treatment-effect (ITE) in settings such
as precision medicine and targeted advertising has peaked in application.
Optimising this ITE under the strong-ignorability-assumption -- meaning all
confounders expressing influence on the outcome of a treatment are registered
in the data -- is often referred to as uplift modeling (UM). While these
techniques have proven useful in many settings, they suffer vividly in a
dynamic environment due to concept drift. Take for example the negative
influence on a marketing campaign when a competitor product is released. To
counter this, we propose the uplifted contextual multi-armed bandit (U-CMAB), a
novel approach to optimise the ITE by drawing upon bandit literature.
Experiments on real and simulated data indicate that our proposed approach
compares favourably against the state-of-the-art. All our code can be found
online at https://github.com/vub-dl/u-cmab.

    <title>Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks on Low-Power Wearable Platforms
  for Cardiac Arrhythmia Detection</title>
    <summary>  Low-power sensing technologies, such as wearables, have emerged in the
healthcare domain since they enable continuous and non-invasive monitoring of
physiological signals. In order to endow such devices with clinical value,
classical signal processing has encountered numerous challenges. However,
data-driven methods, such as machine learning, offer attractive accuracies at
the expense of being resource and memory demanding. In this paper, we focus on
the inference of neural networks running in microcontrollers and low-power
processors which wearable sensors and devices are generally equipped with. In
particular, we adapted an existing convolutional-recurrent neural network,
designed to detect and classify cardiac arrhythmias from a single-lead
electrocardiogram, to the low-power embedded System-on-Chip nRF52 from Nordic
Semiconductor with an ARM's Cortex-M4 processing core. We show our
implementation in fixed-point precision, using the CMSIS-NN libraries, yields a
drop of $F_1$ score from 0.8 to 0.784, from the original implementation, with a
memory footprint of 195.6KB, and a throughput of 33.98MOps/s.

    <title>Machine Learning for Predicting Epileptic Seizures Using EEG Signals: A
  Review</title>
    <summary>  With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques
for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the
early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive
interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized
by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the
adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in
advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved
problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate
amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new
developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a
paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here
we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early
prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps,
challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future
directions.

    <title>Flexible Group Fairness Metrics for Survival Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Algorithmic fairness is an increasingly important field concerned with
detecting and mitigating biases in machine learning models. There has been a
wealth of literature for algorithmic fairness in regression and classification
however there has been little exploration of the field for survival analysis.
Survival analysis is the prediction task in which one attempts to predict the
probability of an event occurring over time. Survival predictions are
particularly important in sensitive settings such as when utilising machine
learning for diagnosis and prognosis of patients. In this paper we explore how
to utilise existing survival metrics to measure bias with group fairness
metrics. We explore this in an empirical experiment with 29 survival datasets
and 8 measures. We find that measures of discrimination are able to capture
bias well whereas there is less clarity with measures of calibration and
scoring rules. We suggest further areas for research including prediction-based
fairness metrics for distribution predictions.

    <title>Building Trust: Lessons from the Technion-Rambam Machine Learning in
  Healthcare Datathon Event</title>
    <summary>  A datathon is a time-constrained competition involving data science applied
to a specific problem. In the past decade, datathons have been shown to be a
valuable bridge between fields and expertise . Biomedical data analysis
represents a challenging area requiring collaboration between engineers,
biologists and physicians to gain a better understanding of patient physiology
and of guide decision processes for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic
interventions to improve care practice. Here, we reflect on the outcomes of an
event that we organized in Israel at the end of March 2022 between the MIT
Critical Data group, Rambam Health Care Campus (Rambam) and the Technion Israel
Institute of Technology (Technion) in Haifa. Participants were asked to
complete a survey about their skills and interests, which enabled us to
identify current needs in machine learning training for medical problem
applications. This work describes opportunities and limitations in medical data
science in the Israeli context.

    <title>Fairness and bias correction in machine learning for depression
  prediction: results from four study populations</title>
    <summary>  A significant level of stigma and inequality exists in mental healthcare,
especially in under-served populations. Inequalities are reflected in the data
collected for scientific purposes. When not properly accounted for, machine
learning (ML) models leart from data can reinforce these structural
inequalities or biases. Here, we present a systematic study of bias in ML
models designed to predict depression in four different case studies covering
different countries and populations. We find that standard ML approaches show
regularly biased behaviors. We also show that mitigation techniques, both
standard and our own post-hoc method, can be effective in reducing the level of
unfair bias. No single best ML model for depression prediction provides
equality of outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing fairness
during model selection and transparent reporting about the impact of debiasing
interventions. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to develop
bias-aware ML models for depression risk prediction.

    <title>Toward Robust Uncertainty Estimation with Random Activation Functions</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks are in the limelight of machine learning with their
excellent performance in many data-driven applications. However, they can lead
to inaccurate predictions when queried in out-of-distribution data points,
which can have detrimental effects especially in sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and transportation, where erroneous predictions can be very costly
and/or dangerous. Subsequently, quantifying the uncertainty of the output of a
neural network is often leveraged to evaluate the confidence of its
predictions, and ensemble models have proved to be effective in measuring the
uncertainty by utilizing the variance of predictions over a pool of models. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach for uncertainty quantification via
ensembles, called Random Activation Functions (RAFs) Ensemble, that aims at
improving the ensemble diversity toward a more robust estimation, by
accommodating each neural network with a different (random) activation
function. Extensive empirical study demonstrates that RAFs Ensemble outperforms
state-of-the-art ensemble uncertainty quantification methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets in a series of regression tasks.

    <title>Evaluation of Country Dietary Habits Using Machine Learning Techniques
  in Relation to Deaths from COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 disease has affected almost every country in the world. The large
number of infected people and the different mortality rates between countries
has given rise to many hypotheses about the key points that make the virus so
lethal in some places. In this study, the eating habits of 170 countries were
evaluated in order to find correlations between these habits and mortality
rates caused by COVID-19 using machine learning techniques that group the
countries together according to the different distribution of fat, energy, and
protein across 23 different types of food, as well as the amount ingested in
kilograms. Results shown how obesity and the high consumption of fats appear in
countries with the highest death rates, whereas countries with a lower rate
have a higher level of cereal consumption accompanied by a lower total average
intake of kilocalories.

    <title>MDLdroid: a ChainSGD-reduce Approach to Mobile Deep Learning for
  Personal Mobile Sensing</title>
    <summary>  Personal mobile sensing is fast permeating our daily lives to enable activity
monitoring, healthcare and rehabilitation. Combined with deep learning, these
applications have achieved significant success in recent years. Different from
conventional cloud-based paradigms, running deep learning on devices offers
several advantages including data privacy preservation and low-latency response
for both model inference and update. Since data collection is costly in
reality, Google's Federated Learning offers not only complete data privacy but
also better model robustness based on multiple user data. However, personal
mobile sensing applications are mostly user-specific and highly affected by
environment. As a result, continuous local changes may seriously affect the
performance of a global model generated by Federated Learning. In addition,
deploying Federated Learning on a local server, e.g., edge server, may quickly
reach the bottleneck due to resource constraint and serious failure by attacks.
Towards pushing deep learning on devices, we present MDLdroid, a novel
decentralized mobile deep learning framework to enable resource-aware on-device
collaborative learning for personal mobile sensing applications. To address
resource limitation, we propose a ChainSGD-reduce approach which includes a
novel chain-directed Synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to
effectively reduce overhead among multiple devices. We also design an
agent-based multi-goal reinforcement learning mechanism to balance resources in
a fair and efficient manner. Our evaluations show that our model training on
off-the-shelf mobile devices achieves 2x to 3.5x faster than single-device
training, and 1.5x faster than the master-slave approach.

    <title>Deep learning for photoacoustic imaging: a survey</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning has been developed dramatically and witnessed a lot of
applications in various fields over the past few years. This boom originated in
2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network,
which began to surpass other established mature models on some important
benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from
image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and
now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks
have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis,
medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both
pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview
of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning
to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in
photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing
deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that
apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging,
from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open
source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying
deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.

    <title>ACReL: Adversarial Conditional value-at-risk Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  In the classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) setting, one aims to find a
policy that maximizes its expected return. This objective may be inappropriate
in safety-critical domains such as healthcare or autonomous driving, where
intrinsic uncertainties due to stochastic policies and environment variability
may lead to catastrophic failures. This can be addressed by using the
Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective to instill risk-aversion in learned
policies. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Cvar Reinforcement Learning
(ACReL), a novel adversarial meta-algorithm to optimize the CVaR objective in
RL. ACReL is based on a max-min between a policy player and a learned adversary
that perturbs the policy player's state transitions given a finite budget. We
prove that, the closer the players are to the game's equilibrium point, the
closer the learned policy is to the CVaR-optimal one with a risk tolerance
explicitly related to the adversary's budget. We provide a gradient-based
training procedure to solve the proposed game by formulating it as a
Stackelberg game, enabling the use of deep RL architectures and training
algorithms. Empirical experiments show that ACReL matches a CVaR RL
state-of-the-art baseline for retrieving CVaR optimal policies, while also
benefiting from theoretical guarantees.

    <title>Graph-Text Multi-Modal Pre-training for Medical Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  As the volume of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharply grows, there has
been emerging interest in learning the representation of EHR for healthcare
applications. Representation learning of EHR requires appropriate modeling of
the two dominant modalities in EHR: structured data and unstructured text. In
this paper, we present MedGTX, a pre-trained model for multi-modal
representation learning of the structured and textual EHR data. MedGTX uses a
novel graph encoder to exploit the graphical nature of structured EHR data, and
a text encoder to handle unstructured text, and a cross-modal encoder to learn
a joint representation space. We pre-train our model through four proxy tasks
on MIMIC-III, an open-source EHR data, and evaluate our model on two clinical
benchmarks and three novel downstream tasks which tackle real-world problems in
EHR data. The results consistently show the effectiveness of pre-training the
model for joint representation of both structured and unstructured information
from EHR. Given the promising performance of MedGTX, we believe this work opens
a new door to jointly understanding the two fundamental modalities of EHR data.

    <title>SimPer: Simple Self-Supervised Learning of Periodic Targets</title>
    <summary>  From human physiology to environmental evolution, important processes in
nature often exhibit meaningful and strong periodic or quasi-periodic changes.
Due to their inherent label scarcity, learning useful representations for
periodic tasks with limited or no supervision is of great benefit. Yet,
existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods overlook the intrinsic
periodicity in data, and fail to learn representations that capture periodic or
frequency attributes. In this paper, we present SimPer, a simple contrastive
SSL regime for learning periodic information in data. To exploit the periodic
inductive bias, SimPer introduces customized augmentations, feature similarity
measures, and a generalized contrastive loss for learning efficient and robust
periodic representations. Extensive experiments on common real-world tasks in
human behavior analysis, environmental sensing, and healthcare domains verify
the superior performance of SimPer compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods,
highlighting its intriguing properties including better data efficiency,
robustness to spurious correlations, and generalization to distribution shifts.

    <title>A Survey on Federated Learning Poisoning Attacks and Defenses</title>
    <summary>  As one kind of distributed machine learning technique, federated learning
enables multiple clients to build a model across decentralized data
collaboratively without explicitly aggregating the data. Due to its ability to
break data silos, federated learning has received increasing attention in many
fields, including finance, healthcare, and education. However, the invisibility
of clients' training data and the local training process result in some
security issues. Recently, many works have been proposed to research the
security attacks and defenses in federated learning, but there has been no
special survey on poisoning attacks on federated learning and the corresponding
defenses. In this paper, we investigate the most advanced schemes of federated
learning poisoning attacks and defenses and point out the future directions in
these areas.

    <title>Vision Through the Veil: Differential Privacy in Federated Learning for
  Medical Image Classification</title>
    <summary>  The proliferation of deep learning applications in healthcare calls for data
aggregation across various institutions, a practice often associated with
significant privacy concerns. This concern intensifies in medical image
analysis, where privacy-preserving mechanisms are paramount due to the data
being sensitive in nature. Federated learning, which enables cooperative model
training without direct data exchange, presents a promising solution.
Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerabilities of federated learning necessitate
further privacy safeguards. This study addresses this need by integrating
differential privacy, a leading privacy-preserving technique, into a federated
learning framework for medical image classification. We introduce a novel
differentially private federated learning model and meticulously examine its
impacts on privacy preservation and model performance. Our research confirms
the existence of a trade-off between model accuracy and privacy settings.
However, we demonstrate that strategic calibration of the privacy budget in
differential privacy can uphold robust image classification performance while
providing substantial privacy protection.

    <title>EHRSHOT: An EHR Benchmark for Few-Shot Evaluation of Foundation Models</title>
    <summary>  While the general machine learning (ML) community has benefited from public
datasets, tasks, and models, the progress of ML in healthcare has been hampered
by a lack of such shared assets. The success of foundation models creates new
challenges for healthcare ML by requiring access to shared pretrained models to
validate performance benefits. We help address these challenges through three
contributions. First, we publish a new dataset, EHRSHOT, which contains
deidentified structured data from the electronic health records (EHRs) of 6,739
patients from Stanford Medicine. Unlike MIMIC-III/IV and other popular EHR
datasets, EHRSHOT is longitudinal and not restricted to ICU/ED patients.
Second, we publish the weights of CLMBR-T-base, a 141M parameter clinical
foundation model pretrained on the structured EHR data of 2.57M patients. We
are one of the first to fully release such a model for coded EHR data; in
contrast, most prior models released for clinical data (e.g. GatorTron,
ClinicalBERT) only work with unstructured text and cannot process the rich,
structured data within an EHR. We provide an end-to-end pipeline for the
community to validate and build upon its performance. Third, we define 15
few-shot clinical prediction tasks, enabling evaluation of foundation models on
benefits such as sample efficiency and task adaptation. Our model and dataset
are available via a research data use agreement from our website:
https://ehrshot.stanford.edu. Code to reproduce our results are available at
our Github repo: https://github.com/som-shahlab/ehrshot-benchmark

    <title>A Single RGB Camera Based Gait Analysis with a Mobile Tele-Robot for
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  With the increasing awareness of high-quality life, there is a growing need
for health monitoring devices running robust algorithms in home environment.
Health monitoring technologies enable real-time analysis of users' health
status, offering long-term healthcare support and reducing hospitalization
time. The purpose of this work is twofold, the software focuses on the analysis
of gait, which is widely adopted for joint correction and assessing any lower
limb or spinal problem. On the hardware side, we design a novel marker-less
gait analysis device using a low-cost RGB camera mounted on a mobile
tele-robot. As gait analysis with a single camera is much more challenging
compared to previous works utilizing multi-cameras, a RGB-D camera or wearable
sensors, we propose using vision-based human pose estimation approaches. More
specifically, based on the output of two state-of-the-art human pose estimation
models (Openpose and VNect), we devise measurements for four bespoke gait
parameters: inversion/eversion, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, ankle and foot
progression angles. We thereby classify walking patterns into normal,
supination, pronation and limp. We also illustrate how to run the purposed
machine learning models in low-resource environments such as a single
entry-level CPU. Experiments show that our single RGB camera method achieves
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods based on depth
cameras or multi-camera motion capture system, at smaller hardware costs.

    <title>Graph-Driven Generative Models for Heterogeneous Multi-Task Learning</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel graph-driven generative model, that unifies multiple
heterogeneous learning tasks into the same framework. The proposed model is
based on the fact that heterogeneous learning tasks, which correspond to
different generative processes, often rely on data with a shared graph
structure. Accordingly, our model combines a graph convolutional network (GCN)
with multiple variational autoencoders, thus embedding the nodes of the graph
i.e., samples for the tasks) in a uniform manner while specializing their
organization and usage to different tasks. With a focus on healthcare
applications (tasks), including clinical topic modeling, procedure
recommendation and admission-type prediction, we demonstrate that our method
successfully leverages information across different tasks, boosting performance
in all tasks and outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    <title>Estimation of Bounds on Potential Outcomes For Decision Making</title>
    <summary>  Estimation of individual treatment effects is commonly used as the basis for
contextual decision making in fields such as healthcare, education, and
economics. However, it is often sufficient for the decision maker to have
estimates of upper and lower bounds on the potential outcomes of decision
alternatives to assess risks and benefits. We show that, in such cases, we can
improve sample efficiency by estimating simple functions that bound these
outcomes instead of estimating their conditional expectations, which may be
complex and hard to estimate. Our analysis highlights a trade-off between the
complexity of the learning task and the confidence with which the learned
bounds hold. Guided by these findings, we develop an algorithm for learning
upper and lower bounds on potential outcomes which optimize an objective
function defined by the decision maker, subject to the probability that bounds
are violated being small. Using a clinical dataset and a well-known causality
benchmark, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines, providing
tighter, more reliable bounds.

    <title>Rhino: Deep Causal Temporal Relationship Learning With History-dependent
  Noise</title>
    <summary>  Discovering causal relationships between different variables from time series
data has been a long-standing challenge for many domains such as climate
science, finance, and healthcare. Given the complexity of real-world
relationships and the nature of observations in discrete time, causal discovery
methods need to consider non-linear relations between variables, instantaneous
effects and history-dependent noise (the change of noise distribution due to
past actions). However, previous works do not offer a solution addressing all
these problems together. In this paper, we propose a novel causal relationship
learning framework for time-series data, called Rhino, which combines vector
auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear
relationships with instantaneous effects while allowing the noise distribution
to be modulated by historical observations. Theoretically, we prove the
structural identifiability of Rhino. Our empirical results from extensive
synthetic experiments and two real-world benchmarks demonstrate better
discovery performance compared to relevant baselines, with ablation studies
revealing its robustness under model misspecification.

    <title>Multimodal Learning for Multi-Omics: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  With advanced imaging, sequencing, and profiling technologies, multiple omics
data become increasingly available and hold promises for many healthcare
applications such as cancer diagnosis and treatment. Multimodal learning for
integrative multi-omics analysis can help researchers and practitioners gain
deep insights into human diseases and improve clinical decisions. However,
several challenges are hindering the development in this area, including the
availability of easily accessible open-source tools. This survey aims to
provide an up-to-date overview of the data challenges, fusion approaches,
datasets, and software tools from several new perspectives. We identify and
investigate various omics data challenges that can help us understand the field
better. We categorize fusion approaches comprehensively to cover existing
methods in this area. We collect existing open-source tools to facilitate their
broader utilization and development. We explore a broad range of omics data
modalities and a list of accessible datasets. Finally, we summarize future
directions that can potentially address existing gaps and answer the pressing
need to advance multimodal learning for multi-omics data analysis.

    <title>Automated Multi-Task Learning for Joint Disease Prediction on Electronic
  Health Records</title>
    <summary>  In the realm of big data and digital healthcare, Electronic Health Records
(EHR) have become a rich source of information with the potential to improve
patient care and medical research. In recent years, machine learning models
have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients future health
conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to
jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction
performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for
EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human
experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model
architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design,
we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal
configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the
vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we
employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover
the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework. It achieves significant
performance improvements over both hand-crafted and automated state-of-the-art
methods, also maintains a feasible search cost at the same time.

    <title>Transferring Knowledge from Text to Predict Disease Onset</title>
    <summary>  In many domains such as medicine, training data is in short supply. In such
cases, external knowledge is often helpful in building predictive models. We
propose a novel method to incorporate publicly available domain expertise to
build accurate models. Specifically, we use word2vec models trained on a
domain-specific corpus to estimate the relevance of each feature's text
description to the prediction problem. We use these relevance estimates to
rescale the features, causing more important features to experience weaker
regularization.
  We apply our method to predict the onset of five chronic diseases in the next
five years in two genders and two age groups. Our rescaling approach improves
the accuracy of the model, particularly when there are few positive examples.
Furthermore, our method selects 60% fewer features, easing interpretation by
physicians. Our method is applicable to other domains where feature and outcome
descriptions are available.

    <title>Imputation of Clinical Covariates in Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Missing data is a common problem in real-world settings and particularly
relevant in healthcare applications where researchers use Electronic Health
Records (EHR) and results of observational studies to apply analytics methods.
This issue becomes even more prominent for longitudinal data sets, where
multiple instances of the same individual correspond to different observations
in time. Standard imputation methods do not take into account patient specific
information incorporated in multivariate panel data. We introduce the novel
imputation algorithm MedImpute that addresses this problem, extending the
flexible framework of OptImpute suggested by Bertsimas et al. (2018). Our
algorithm provides imputations for data sets with missing continuous and
categorical features, and we present the formulation and implement scalable
first-order methods for a $K$-NN model. We test the performance of our
algorithm on longitudinal data from the Framingham Heart Study when data are
missing completely at random (MCAR). We demonstrate that MedImpute leads to
significant improvements in both imputation accuracy and downstream model AUC
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>Missing Data in Sparse Transition Matrix Estimation for Sub-Gaussian
  Vector Autoregressive Processes</title>
    <summary>  High-dimensional time series data exist in numerous areas such as finance,
genomics, healthcare, and neuroscience. An unavoidable aspect of all such
datasets is missing data, and dealing with this issue has been an important
focus in statistics, control, and machine learning. In this work, we consider a
high-dimensional estimation problem where a dynamical system, governed by a
stable vector autoregressive model, is randomly and only partially observed at
each time point. Our task amounts to estimating the transition matrix, which is
assumed to be sparse. In such a scenario, where covariates are highly
interdependent and partially missing, new theoretical challenges arise. While
transition matrix estimation in vector autoregressive models has been studied
previously, the missing data scenario requires separate efforts. Moreover,
while transition matrix estimation can be studied from a high-dimensional
sparse linear regression perspective, the covariates are highly dependent and
existing results on regularized estimation with missing data from
i.i.d.~covariates are not applicable. At the heart of our analysis lies 1) a
novel concentration result when the innovation noise satisfies the convex
concentration property, as well as 2) a new quantity for characterizing the
interactions of the time-varying observation process with the underlying
dynamical system.

    <title>Phenotyping Endometriosis through Mixed Membership Models of
  Self-Tracking Data</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the use of self-tracking data and unsupervised
mixed-membership models to phenotype endometriosis. Endometriosis is a
systemic, chronic condition of women in reproductive age and, at the same time,
a highly enigmatic condition with no known biomarkers to monitor its
progression and no established staging. We leverage data collected through a
self-tracking app in an observational research study of over 2,800 women with
endometriosis tracking their condition over a year and a half (456,900
observations overall). We extend a classical mixed-membership model to
accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the data at hand (i.e., the multimodality of
the tracked variables). Our experiments show that our approach identifies
potential subtypes that are robust in terms of biases of self-tracked data
(e.g., wide variations in tracking frequency amongst participants), as well as
to variations in hyperparameters of the model. Jointly modeling a wide range of
observations about participants (symptoms, quality of life, treatments) yields
clinically meaningful subtypes that both validate what is already known about
endometriosis and suggest new findings.

    <title>A Literature Review on Length of Stay Prediction for Stroke Patients
  using Machine Learning and Statistical Approaches</title>
    <summary>  Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics
that reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital
scheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because
patients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where
resources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS
prediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature
review considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke
patients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached
contradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered
an important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other
studies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional
research is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS
for stroke patients.

    <title>Predictive Analysis for Detection of Human Neck Postures using a robust
  integration of kinetics and kinematics</title>
    <summary>  Human neck postures and movements need to be monitored, measured, quantified
and analyzed, as a preventive measure in healthcare applications. Improper neck
postures are an increasing source of neck musculoskeletal disorders, requiring
therapy and rehabilitation. The motivation for the research presented in this
paper was the need to develop a notification mechanism for improper neck usage.
Kinematic data captured by sensors have limitations in accurately classifying
the neck postures. Hence, we propose an integrated use of kinematic and kinetic
data to efficiently classify neck postures. Using machine learning algorithms
we obtained 100% accuracy in the predictive analysis of this data. The research
analysis and discussions show that the kinetic data of the Hyoid muscles can
accurately detect the neck posture given the corresponding kinematic data
captured by the neck-band. The proposed robust platform for the integration of
kinematic and kinetic data has enabled the design of a smart neck-band for the
prevention of neck musculoskeletal disorders.

    <title>Incorporating Interpretable Output Constraints in Bayesian Neural
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  Domains where supervised models are deployed often come with task-specific
constraints, such as prior expert knowledge on the ground-truth function, or
desiderata like safety and fairness. We introduce a novel probabilistic
framework for reasoning with such constraints and formulate a prior that
enables us to effectively incorporate them into Bayesian neural networks
(BNNs), including a variant that can be amortized over tasks. The resulting
Output-Constrained BNN (OC-BNN) is fully consistent with the Bayesian framework
for uncertainty quantification and is amenable to black-box inference. Unlike
typical BNN inference in uninterpretable parameter space, OC-BNNs widen the
range of functional knowledge that can be incorporated, especially for model
users without expertise in machine learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of
OC-BNNs on real-world datasets, spanning multiple domains such as healthcare,
criminal justice, and credit scoring.

    <title>Feature Attributions and Counterfactual Explanations Can Be Manipulated</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning models are increasingly used in critical decision-making
settings (e.g., healthcare, finance), there has been a growing emphasis on
developing methods to explain model predictions. Such \textit{explanations} are
used to understand and establish trust in models and are vital components in
machine learning pipelines. Though explanations are a critical piece in these
systems, there is little understanding about how they are vulnerable to
manipulation by adversaries. In this paper, we discuss how two broad classes of
explanations are vulnerable to manipulation. We demonstrate how adversaries can
design biased models that manipulate model agnostic feature attribution methods
(e.g., LIME \&amp; SHAP) and counterfactual explanations that hill-climb during the
counterfactual search (e.g., Wachter's Algorithm \&amp; DiCE) into
\textit{concealing} the model's biases. These vulnerabilities allow an
adversary to deploy a biased model, yet explanations will not reveal this bias,
thereby deceiving stakeholders into trusting the model. We evaluate the
manipulations on real world data sets, including COMPAS and Communities \&amp;
Crime, and find explanations can be manipulated in practice.

    <title>Integrating Machine Learning with Discrete Event Simulation for
  Improving Health Referral Processing in a Care Management Setting</title>
    <summary>  Post-discharge care management coordinates patients' referrals to improve
their health after being discharged from hospitals, especially elderly and
chronically ill patients. In a care management setting, health referrals are
processed by a specialized unit in the managed care organization (MCO), which
interacts with many other entities including inpatient hospitals, insurance
companies, and post-discharge care providers. In this paper, a
machine-learning-guided discrete event simulation framework to improve health
referrals processing is proposed. Random-forest-based prediction models are
developed to predict the LOS and referral type. Two simulation models are
constructed to represent the as-is configuration of the referral processing
system and the intelligent system after incorporating the prediction
functionality, respectively. By incorporating a prediction module for the
referral processing system to plan and prioritize referrals, the overall
performance was enhanced in terms of reducing the average referral creation
delay time. This research will emphasize the role of post-discharge care
management in improving health quality and reducing associated costs. Also, the
paper demonstrates how to use integrated systems engineering methods for
process improvement of complex healthcare systems.

    <title>Unsupervised Feature Selection to Identify Important ICD-10 Codes for
  Machine Learning: A Case Study on a Coronary Artery Disease Patient Cohort</title>
    <summary>  The use of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in healthcare
presents a challenge in selecting relevant codes as features for machine
learning models due to this system's large number of codes. In this study, we
compared several unsupervised feature selection methods for an ICD code
database of 49,075 coronary artery disease patients in Alberta, Canada.
Specifically, we employed Laplacian Score, Unsupervised Feature Selection for
Multi-Cluster Data, Autoencoder Inspired Unsupervised Feature Selection,
Principal Feature Analysis, and Concrete Autoencoders with and without ICD tree
weight adjustment to select the 100 best features from over 9,000 codes. We
assessed the selected features based on their ability to reconstruct the
initial feature space and predict 90-day mortality following discharge. Our
findings revealed that the Concrete Autoencoder methods outperformed all other
methods in both tasks. Furthermore, the weight adjustment in the Concrete
Autoencoder method decreased the complexity of features.

    <title>Epidemic outbreak prediction using machine learning models</title>
    <summary>  In today's world,the risk of emerging and re-emerging epidemics have
increased.The recent advancement in healthcare technology has made it possible
to predict an epidemic outbreak in a region.Early prediction of an epidemic
outbreak greatly helps the authorities to be prepared with the necessary
medications and logistics required to keep things in control. In this article,
we try to predict the epidemic outbreak (influenza, hepatitis and malaria) for
the state of New York, USA using machine and deep learning algorithms, and a
portal has been created for the same which can alert the authorities and health
care organizations of the region in case of an outbreak. The algorithm takes
historical data to predict the possible number of cases for 5 weeks into the
future. Non-clinical factors like google search trends,social media data and
weather data have also been used to predict the probability of an outbreak.

    <title>PoseAction: Action Recognition for Patients in the Ward using Deep
  Learning Approaches</title>
    <summary>  Real-time intelligent detection and prediction of subjects' behavior
particularly their movements or actions is critical in the ward. This approach
offers the advantage of reducing in-hospital care costs and improving the
efficiency of healthcare workers, which is especially true for scenarios at
night or during peak admission periods. Therefore, in this work, we propose
using computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) methods for detecting
subjects and recognizing their actions. We utilize OpenPose as an accurate
subject detector for recognizing the positions of human subjects in the video
stream. Additionally, we employ AlphAction's Asynchronous Interaction
Aggregation (AIA) network to predict the actions of detected subjects. This
integrated model, referred to as PoseAction, is proposed. At the same time, the
proposed model is further trained to predict 12 common actions in ward areas,
such as staggering, chest pain, and falling down, using medical-related video
clips from the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets. The results demonstrate
that PoseAction achieves the highest classification mAP of 98.72% (IoU@0.5).
Additionally, this study develops an online real-time mode for action
recognition, which strongly supports the clinical translation of PoseAction.
Furthermore, using OpenPose's function for recognizing face key points, we also
implement face blurring, which is a practical solution to address the privacy
protection concerns of patients and healthcare workers. Nevertheless, the
training data for PoseAction is currently limited, particularly in terms of
label diversity. Consequently, the subsequent step involves utilizing a more
diverse dataset (including general actions) to train the model's parameters for
improved generalization.

    <title>MedML: Fusing Medical Knowledge and Machine Learning Models for Early
  Pediatric COVID-19 Hospitalization and Severity Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused devastating economic and social disruption,
straining the resources of healthcare institutions worldwide. This has led to a
nationwide call for models to predict hospitalization and severe illness in
patients with COVID-19 to inform distribution of limited healthcare resources.
We respond to one of these calls specific to the pediatric population. To
address this challenge, we study two prediction tasks for the pediatric
population using electronic health records: 1) predicting which children are
more likely to be hospitalized, and 2) among hospitalized children, which
individuals are more likely to develop severe symptoms.
  We respond to the national Pediatric COVID-19 data challenge with a novel
machine learning model, MedML. MedML extracts the most predictive features
based on medical knowledge and propensity scores from over 6 million medical
concepts and incorporates the inter-feature relationships between heterogeneous
medical features via graph neural networks (GNN). We evaluate MedML across
143,605 patients for the hospitalization prediction task and 11,465 patients
for the severity prediction task using data from the National Cohort
Collaborative (N3C) dataset. We also report detailed group-level and
individual-level feature importance analyses to evaluate the model
interpretability.
  MedML achieves up to a 7% higher AUROC score and up to a 14% higher AUPRC
score compared to the best baseline machine learning models and performs well
across all nine national geographic regions and over all three-month spans
since the start of the pandemic. Our cross-disciplinary research team has
developed a method of incorporating clinical domain knowledge as the framework
for a new type of machine learning model that is more predictive and
explainable than current state-of-the-art data-driven feature selection
methods.

    <title>Quantum AI for Alzheimer's disease early screening</title>
    <summary>  Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum
information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies seem
to be particularly well suited to solving problems in the health sector in an
efficient way, because they may deal with large datasets more efficiently than
classical AI.
  Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects
elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common
cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities
and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early
diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting
can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The
DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting
samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy
people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this
dataset to test kernel methods for classification task and compare their
performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We
find that quantum and classical algorithms achieve similar performances and in
some cases quantum methods perform even better.
  Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications
in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.

    <title>MedPerf: Open Benchmarking Platform for Medical Artificial Intelligence
  using Federated Evaluation</title>
    <summary>  Medical AI has tremendous potential to advance healthcare by supporting the
evidence-based practice of medicine, personalizing patient treatment, reducing
costs, and improving provider and patient experience. We argue that unlocking
this potential requires a systematic way to measure the performance of medical
AI models on large-scale heterogeneous data. To meet this need, we are building
MedPerf, an open framework for benchmarking machine learning in the medical
domain. MedPerf will enable federated evaluation in which models are securely
distributed to different facilities for evaluation, thereby empowering
healthcare organizations to assess and verify the performance of AI models in
an efficient and human-supervised process, while prioritizing privacy. We
describe the current challenges healthcare and AI communities face, the need
for an open platform, the design philosophy of MedPerf, its current
implementation status, and our roadmap. We call for researchers and
organizations to join us in creating the MedPerf open benchmarking platform.

    <title>Assessing Robustness to Noise: Low-Cost Head CT Triage</title>
    <summary>  Automated medical image classification with convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) has great potential to impact healthcare, particularly in
resource-constrained healthcare systems where fewer trained radiologists are
available. However, little is known about how well a trained CNN can perform on
images with the increased noise levels, different acquisition protocols, or
additional artifacts that may arise when using low-cost scanners, which can be
underrepresented in datasets collected from well-funded hospitals. In this
work, we investigate how a model trained to triage head computed tomography
(CT) scans performs on images acquired with reduced x-ray tube current, fewer
projections per gantry rotation, and limited angle scans. These changes can
reduce the cost of the scanner and demands on electrical power but come at the
expense of increased image noise and artifacts. We first develop a model to
triage head CTs and report an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) of 0.77. We then show that the trained model is robust to reduced
tube current and fewer projections, with the AUROC dropping only 0.65% for
images acquired with a 16x reduction in tube current and 0.22% for images
acquired with 8x fewer projections. Finally, for significantly degraded images
acquired by a limited angle scan, we show that a model trained specifically to
classify such images can overcome the technological limitations to
reconstruction and maintain an AUROC within 0.09% of the original model.

    <title>Local Interpretability of Calibrated Prediction Models: A Case of Type 2
  Diabetes Mellitus Screening Test</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) models are often complex and difficult to interpret due
to their 'black-box' characteristics. Interpretability of a ML model is usually
defined as the degree to which a human can understand the cause of decisions
reached by a ML model. Interpretability is of extremely high importance in many
fields of healthcare due to high levels of risk related to decisions based on
ML models. Calibration of the ML model outputs is another issue often
overlooked in the application of ML models in practice. This paper represents
an early work in examination of prediction model calibration impact on the
interpretability of the results. We present a use case of a patient in diabetes
screening prediction scenario and visualize results using three different
techniques to demonstrate the differences between calibrated and uncalibrated
regularized regression model.

    <title>Drug Recommendation System based on Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews
  using Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical
resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists, healthcare workers,
lack of proper equipment and medicines. The entire medical fraternity is in
distress, which results in numerous individuals demise. Due to unavailability,
people started taking medication independently without appropriate
consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. As of late, machine
learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase
in innovative work for automation. This paper intends to present a drug
recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. In this
research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews
to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like Bow, TFIDF,
Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, which can help recommend the top drug
for a given disease by different classification algorithms. The predicted
sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and AUC
score. The results show that classifier LinearSVC using TFIDF vectorization
outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy.

    <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection for Medical Applications: Guidelines for
  Practical Evaluation</title>
    <summary>  Detection of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples in real time is a crucial
safety check for deployment of machine learning models in the medical field.
Despite a growing number of uncertainty quantification techniques, there is a
lack of evaluation guidelines on how to select OOD detection methods in
practice. This gap impedes implementation of OOD detection methods for
real-world applications. Here, we propose a series of practical considerations
and tests to choose the best OOD detector for a specific medical dataset. These
guidelines are illustrated on a real-life use case of Electronic Health Records
(EHR). Our results can serve as a guide for implementation of OOD detection
methods in clinical practice, mitigating risks associated with the use of
machine learning models in healthcare.

    <title>A Review of Speech-centric Trustworthy Machine Learning: Privacy,
  Safety, and Fairness</title>
    <summary>  Speech-centric machine learning systems have revolutionized many leading
domains ranging from transportation and healthcare to education and defense,
profoundly changing how people live, work, and interact with each other.
However, recent studies have demonstrated that many speech-centric ML systems
may need to be considered more trustworthy for broader deployment.
Specifically, concerns over privacy breaches, discriminating performance, and
vulnerability to adversarial attacks have all been discovered in ML research
fields. In order to address the above challenges and risks, a significant
number of efforts have been made to ensure these ML systems are trustworthy,
especially private, safe, and fair. In this paper, we conduct the first
comprehensive survey on speech-centric trustworthy ML topics related to
privacy, safety, and fairness. In addition to serving as a summary report for
the research community, we point out several promising future research
directions to inspire the researchers who wish to explore further in this area.

    <title>Blockchain based Attack Detection on Machine Learning Algorithms for IoT
  based E-Health Applications</title>
    <summary>  The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms are massively scaling-up
due to rapid digitization and emergence of new tecnologies like Internet of
Things (IoT). In today's digital era, we can find ML algorithms being applied
in the areas of healthcare, IoT, engineering, finance and so on. However, all
these algorithms need to be trained in order to predict/solve a particular
problem. There is high possibility of tampering the training datasets and
produce biased results. Hence, in this article, we have proposed blockchain
based solution to secure the datasets generated from IoT devices for E-Health
applications. The proposed blockchain based solution uses using private cloud
to tackle the aforementioned issue. For evaluation, we have developed a system
that can be used by dataset owners to secure their data.

    <title>Hierarchical Analysis of Visual COVID-19 Features from Chest Radiographs</title>
    <summary>  Chest radiography has been a recommended procedure for patient triaging and
resource management in intensive care units (ICUs) throughout the COVID-19
pandemic. The machine learning efforts to augment this workflow have been long
challenged due to deficiencies in reporting, model evaluation, and failure mode
analysis. To address some of those shortcomings, we model radiological features
with a human-interpretable class hierarchy that aligns with the radiological
decision process. Also, we propose the use of a data-driven error analysis
methodology to uncover the blind spots of our model, providing further
transparency on its clinical utility. For example, our experiments show that
model failures highly correlate with ICU imaging conditions and with the
inherent difficulty in distinguishing certain types of radiological features.
Also, our hierarchical interpretation and analysis facilitates the comparison
with respect to radiologists' findings and inter-variability, which in return
helps us to better assess the clinical applicability of models.

    <title>One-class Autoencoder Approach for Optimal Electrode Set-up
  Identification in Wearable EEG Event Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  A limiting factor towards the wide routine use of wearables devices for
continuous healthcare monitoring is their cumbersome and obtrusive nature. This
is particularly true for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which require
the placement of multiple electrodes in contact with the scalp. In this work,
we propose to identify the optimal wearable EEG electrode set-up, in terms of
minimal number of electrodes, comfortable location and performance, for
EEG-based event detection and monitoring. By relying on the demonstrated power
of autoencoder (AE) networks to learn latent representations from
high-dimensional data, our proposed strategy trains an AE architecture in a
one-class classification setup with different electrode set-ups as input data.
The resulting models are assessed using the F-score and the best set-up is
chosen according to the established optimal criteria. Using alpha wave
detection as use case, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to detect
an alpha state from an optimal set-up consisting of electrodes in the forehead
and behind the ear, with an average F-score of 0.78. Our results suggest that a
learning-based approach can be used to enable the design and implementation of
optimized wearable devices for real-life healthcare monitoring.

    <title>Are Generative AI systems Capable of Supporting Information Needs of
  Patients?</title>
    <summary>  Patients managing a complex illness such as cancer face a complex information
challenge where they not only must learn about their illness but also how to
manage it. Close interaction with healthcare experts (radiologists,
oncologists) can improve patient learning and thereby, their disease outcome.
However, this approach is resource intensive and takes expert time away from
other critical tasks. Given the recent advancements in Generative AI models
aimed at improving the healthcare system, our work investigates whether and how
generative visual question answering systems can responsibly support patient
information needs in the context of radiology imaging data. We conducted a
formative need-finding study in which participants discussed chest computed
tomography (CT) scans and associated radiology reports of a fictitious close
relative with a cardiothoracic radiologist. Using thematic analysis of the
conversation between participants and medical experts, we identified commonly
occurring themes across interactions, including clarifying medical terminology,
locating the problems mentioned in the report in the scanned image,
understanding disease prognosis, discussing the next diagnostic steps, and
comparing treatment options. Based on these themes, we evaluated two
state-of-the-art generative visual language models against the radiologist's
responses. Our results reveal variability in the quality of responses generated
by the models across various themes. We highlight the importance of
patient-facing generative AI systems to accommodate a diverse range of
conversational themes, catering to the real-world informational needs of
patients.

    <title>Detection and Prediction of Cardiac Anomalies Using Wireless Body
  Sensors and Bayesian Belief Networks</title>
    <summary>  Intricating cardiac complexities are the primary factor associated with
healthcare costs and the highest cause of death rate in the world. However,
preventive measures like the early detection of cardiac anomalies can prevent
severe cardiovascular arrests of varying complexities and can impose a
substantial impact on healthcare cost. Encountering such scenarios usually the
electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is the first diagnostic choice of a medical
practitioner or clinical staff to measure the electrical and muscular fitness
of an individual heart. This paper presents a system which is capable of
reading the recorded ECG and predict the cardiac anomalies without the
intervention of a human expert. The paper purpose an algorithm which read and
perform analysis on electrocardiogram datasets. The proposed architecture uses
the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) at first place to perform preprocessing of
ECG data followed by undecimated Wavelet transform (UWT) to extract nine
relevant features which are of high interest to a cardiologist. The
probabilistic mode named Bayesian Network Classifier is trained using the
extracted nine parameters on UCL arrhythmia dataset. The proposed system
classifies a recorded heartbeat into four classes using Bayesian Network
classifier and Tukey's box analysis. The four classes for the prediction of a
heartbeat are (a) Normal Beat, (b) Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) (c)
Premature Atrial Contraction (PAC) and (d) Myocardial Infarction. The results
of experimental setup depict that the proposed system has achieved an average
accuracy of 96.6 for PAC\% 92.8\% for MI and 87\% for PVC, with an average
error rate of 3.3\% for PAC, 6\% for MI and 12.5\% for PVC on real
electrocardiogram datasets including Physionet and European ST-T Database
(EDB).

    <title>Approval policies for modifications to Machine Learning-Based Software
  as a Medical Device: A study of bio-creep</title>
    <summary>  Successful deployment of machine learning algorithms in healthcare requires
careful assessments of their performance and safety. To date, the FDA approves
locked algorithms prior to marketing and requires future updates to undergo
separate premarket reviews. However, this negates a key feature of machine
learning--the ability to learn from a growing dataset and improve over time.
This paper frames the design of an approval policy, which we refer to as an
automatic algorithmic change protocol (aACP), as an online hypothesis testing
problem. As this process has obvious analogy with noninferiority testing of new
drugs, we investigate how repeated testing and adoption of modifications might
lead to gradual deterioration in prediction accuracy, also known as
``biocreep'' in the drug development literature. We consider simple policies
that one might consider but do not necessarily offer any error-rate guarantees,
as well as policies that do provide error-rate control. For the latter, we
define two online error-rates appropriate for this context: Bad Approval Count
(BAC) and Bad Approval and Benchmark Ratios (BABR). We control these rates in
the simple setting of a constant population and data source using policies
aACP-BAC and aACP-BABR, which combine alpha-investing, group-sequential, and
gate-keeping methods. In simulation studies, bio-creep regularly occurred when
using policies with no error-rate guarantees, whereas aACP-BAC and -BABR
controlled the rate of bio-creep without substantially impacting our ability to
approve beneficial modifications.

    <title>Decentralized Federated Learning through Proxy Model Sharing</title>
    <summary>  Institutions in highly regulated domains such as finance and healthcare often
have restrictive rules around data sharing. Federated learning is a distributed
learning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on
decentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data
privacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for
decentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated
learning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model,
and a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's
privacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants
without the need of a centralized server. The proposed method eliminates a
significant limitation of canonical federated learning by allowing model
heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with any architecture.
Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to stronger privacy
guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on popular image
datasets, and a cancer diagnostic problem using high-quality gigapixel
histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can outperform existing
alternatives with much less communication overhead and stronger privacy.

    <title>Representation Learning of Daily Movement Data Using Text Encoders</title>
    <summary>  Time-series representation learning is a key area of research for remote
healthcare monitoring applications. In this work, we focus on a dataset of
recordings of in-home activity from people living with Dementia. We design a
representation learning method based on converting activity to text strings
that can be encoded using a language model fine-tuned to transform data from
the same participants within a $30$-day window to similar embeddings in the
vector space. This allows for clustering and vector searching over participants
and days, and the identification of activity deviations to aid with
personalised delivery of care.

    <title>SCALPEL3: a scalable open-source library for healthcare claims databases</title>
    <summary>  This article introduces SCALPEL3, a scalable open-source framework for
studies involving Large Observational Databases (LODs). Its design eases
medical observational studies thanks to abstractions allowing concept
extraction, high-level cohort manipulation, and production of data formats
compatible with machine learning libraries. SCALPEL3 has successfully been used
on the SNDS database (see Tuppin et al. (2017)), a huge healthcare claims
database that handles the reimbursement of almost all French citizens.
  SCALPEL3 focuses on scalability, easy interactive analysis and helpers for
data flow analysis to accelerate studies performed on LODs. It consists of
three open-source libraries based on Apache Spark. SCALPEL-Flattening allows
denormalization of the LOD (only SNDS for now) by joining tables sequentially
in a big table. SCALPEL-Extraction provides fast concept extraction from a big
table such as the one produced by SCALPEL-Flattening. Finally, SCALPEL-Analysis
allows interactive cohort manipulations, monitoring statistics of cohort flows
and building datasets to be used with machine learning libraries. The first two
provide a Scala API while the last one provides a Python API that can be used
in an interactive environment. Our code is available on GitHub.
  SCALPEL3 allowed to extract successfully complex concepts for studies such as
Morel et al (2017) or studies with 14.5 million patients observed over three
years (corresponding to more than 15 billion healthcare events and roughly 15
TeraBytes of data) in less than 49 minutes on a small 15 nodes HDFS cluster.
SCALPEL3 provides a sharp interactive control of data processing through
legible code, which helps to build studies with full reproducibility, leading
to improved maintainability and audit of studies performed on LODs.

    <title>WisPerMed at "Discharge Me!": Advancing Text Generation in Healthcare
  with Large Language Models, Dynamic Expert Selection, and Priming Techniques
  on MIMIC-IV</title>
    <summary>  This study aims to leverage state of the art language models to automate
generating the "Brief Hospital Course" and "Discharge Instructions" sections of
Discharge Summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset, reducing clinicians'
administrative workload. We investigate how automation can improve
documentation accuracy, alleviate clinician burnout, and enhance operational
efficacy in healthcare facilities. This research was conducted within our
participation in the Shared Task Discharge Me! at BioNLP @ ACL 2024. Various
strategies were employed, including few-shot learning, instruction tuning, and
Dynamic Expert Selection (DES), to develop models capable of generating the
required text sections. Notably, utilizing an additional clinical
domain-specific dataset demonstrated substantial potential to enhance clinical
language processing. The DES method, which optimizes the selection of text
outputs from multiple predictions, proved to be especially effective. It
achieved the highest overall score of 0.332 in the competition, surpassing
single-model outputs. This finding suggests that advanced deep learning methods
in combination with DES can effectively automate parts of electronic health
record documentation. These advancements could enhance patient care by freeing
clinician time for patient interactions. The integration of text selection
strategies represents a promising avenue for further research.

    <title>DTR-Bench: An in silico Environment and Benchmark Platform for
  Reinforcement Learning Based Dynamic Treatment Regime</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing recognition for its
potential to optimise dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) in personalised
medicine, particularly for drug dosage prescriptions and medication
recommendations. However, a significant challenge persists: the absence of a
unified framework for simulating diverse healthcare scenarios and a
comprehensive analysis to benchmark the effectiveness of RL algorithms within
these contexts. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{DTR-Bench}, a
benchmarking platform comprising four distinct simulation environments tailored
to common DTR applications, including cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
glucose management in diabetes, and sepsis treatment. We evaluate various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms across these settings, particularly highlighting
their performance amidst real-world challenges such as
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) variability, noise, and missing data.
Our experiments reveal varying degrees of performance degradation among RL
algorithms in the presence of noise and patient variability, with some
algorithms failing to converge. Additionally, we observe that using temporal
observation representations does not consistently lead to improved performance
in DTR settings. Our findings underscore the necessity of developing robust,
adaptive RL algorithms capable of effectively managing these complexities to
enhance patient-specific healthcare. We have open-sourced our benchmark and
code at https://github.com/GilesLuo/DTR-Bench.

    <title>Fooling LIME and SHAP: Adversarial Attacks on Post hoc Explanation
  Methods</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in domains
such as healthcare and criminal justice, there is growing emphasis on building
tools and techniques for explaining these black boxes in an interpretable
manner. Such explanations are being leveraged by domain experts to diagnose
systematic errors and underlying biases of black boxes. In this paper, we
demonstrate that post hoc explanations techniques that rely on input
perturbations, such as LIME and SHAP, are not reliable. Specifically, we
propose a novel scaffolding technique that effectively hides the biases of any
given classifier by allowing an adversarial entity to craft an arbitrary
desired explanation. Our approach can be used to scaffold any biased classifier
in such a way that its predictions on the input data distribution still remain
biased, but the post hoc explanations of the scaffolded classifier look
innocuous. Using extensive evaluation with multiple real-world datasets
(including COMPAS), we demonstrate how extremely biased (racist) classifiers
crafted by our framework can easily fool popular explanation techniques such as
LIME and SHAP into generating innocuous explanations which do not reflect the
underlying biases.

    <title>Causal Markov Boundaries</title>
    <summary>  Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning, which aims to
select variables that lead to an optimal predictive model. In this paper, we
focus on feature selection for post-intervention outcome prediction from
pre-intervention variables. We are motivated by healthcare settings, where the
goal is often to select the treatment that will maximize a specific patient's
outcome; however, we often do not have sufficient randomized control trial data
to identify well the conditional treatment effect. We show how we can use
observational data to improve feature selection and effect estimation in two
cases: (a) using observational data when we know the causal graph, and (b) when
we do not know the causal graph but have observational and limited experimental
data. Our paper extends the notion of Markov boundary to treatment-outcome
pairs. We provide theoretical guarantees for the methods we introduce. In
simulated data, we show that combining observational and experimental data
improves feature selection and effect estimation.

    <title>Self-timed Reinforcement Learning using Tsetlin Machine</title>
    <summary>  We present a hardware design for the learning datapath of the Tsetlin machine
algorithm, along with a latency analysis of the inference datapath. In order to
generate a low energy hardware which is suitable for pervasive artificial
intelligence applications, we use a mixture of asynchronous design techniques -
including Petri nets, signal transition graphs, dual-rail and bundled-data. The
work builds on previous design of the inference hardware, and includes an
in-depth breakdown of the automaton feedback, probability generation and
Tsetlin automata. Results illustrate the advantages of asynchronous design in
applications such as personalized healthcare and battery-powered internet of
things devices, where energy is limited and latency is an important figure of
merit. Challenges of static timing analysis in asynchronous circuits are also
addressed.

    <title>Bayesian inference of a new Mallows model for characterising symptom
  sequences applied in primary progressive aphasia</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models offer the potential to understand diverse datasets in
a data-driven way, powering insights into individual disease experiences and
ensuring equitable healthcare. In this study, we explore Bayesian inference for
characterising symptom sequences, and the associated modelling challenges. We
adapted the Mallows model to account for partial rankings and right-censored
data, employing custom MCMC fitting. Our evaluation, encompassing synthetic
data and a primary progressive aphasia dataset, highlights the model's efficacy
in revealing mean orderings and estimating ranking variance. This holds the
potential to enhance clinical comprehension of symptom occurrence. However, our
work encounters limitations concerning model scalability and small dataset
sizes.

    <title>The Significance of Data Abstraction Methods in Machine Learning
  Classification Processes for Critical Decision-Making</title>
    <summary>  The applicability of widely adopted machine learning (ML) methods to
classification is circumscribed by the imperatives of explicability and
uncertainty, particularly evident in domains such as healthcare, behavioural
sciences, and finances, wherein accountability assumes priority. Recently,
Small and Incomplete Dataset Analyser (SaNDA) has been proposed to enhance the
ability to perform classification in such domains, by developing a data
abstraction protocol using a ROC curve-based method. This paper focuses on
column-wise data transformations called abstractions, which are crucial for
SaNDA's classification process and explores alternative abstractions protocols,
such as constant binning and quantiles. The best-performing methods have been
compared against Random Forest as a baseline for explainable methods. The
results suggests that SaNDA can be a viable substitute for Random Forest when
data is incomplete, even with minimal missing values. It consistently maintains
high accuracy even when half of the dataset is missing, unlike Random Forest
which experiences a significant decline in accuracy under similar conditions.

    <title>A Causally Formulated Hazard Ratio Estimation through Backdoor
  Adjustment on Structural Causal Model</title>
    <summary>  Identifying causal relationships for a treatment intervention is a
fundamental problem in health sciences. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are
considered the gold standard for identifying causal relationships. However,
recent advancements in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations
of structural causal models (SCMs) have allowed the identification of causal
relationships from observational data, under certain assumptions. Survival
analysis provides standard measures, such as the hazard ratio, to quantify the
effects of an intervention. While hazard ratios are widely used in clinical and
epidemiological studies for RCTs, a principled approach does not exist to
compute hazard ratios for observational studies with SCMs. In this work, we
review existing approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their causal
interpretation, if it exists. We also propose a novel approach to compute
hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor adjustment through SCMs
and do-calculus. Finally, we evaluate the approach using experimental data for
Ewing's sarcoma.

    <title>Aligning Subjective Ratings in Clinical Decision Making</title>
    <summary>  In addition to objective indicators (e.g. laboratory values), clinical data
often contain subjective evaluations by experts (e.g. disease severity
assessments). While objective indicators are more transparent and robust, the
subjective evaluation contains a wealth of expert knowledge and intuition. In
this work, we demonstrate the potential of pairwise ranking methods to align
the subjective evaluation with objective indicators, creating a new score that
combines their advantages and facilitates diagnosis. In a case study on
patients at risk for developing Psoriatic Arthritis, we illustrate that the
resulting score (1) increases classification accuracy when detecting disease
presence/absence, (2) is sparse and (3) provides a nuanced assessment of
severity for subsequent analysis.

    <title>Predicting Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury in Rookie Major League
  Baseball Pitchers</title>
    <summary>  In the growing world of machine learning and data analytics, scholars are
finding new and innovative ways to solve real-world problems. One solution
comes by way of an intersection between healthcare, sports statistics, and data
sciences. Within the realm of Major League Baseball (MLB), pitchers are
regarded as the most important roster position. They often are among the
highest paid players and are crucial to a franchise's success, but they are
more at risk to suffer an injury that sidelines them for over a complete
season. The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a small ligament in the elbow
that controls the strength and stability of a pitcher's throwing arm. Due to
repetitive strain, it is not uncommon for pitchers to tear it partially or
completely during their careers. Repairing this injury requires UCL
reconstruction surgery, as known informally as Tommy John surgery. In this
podium abstract, we want to investigate whether we can use machine learning
techniques to predict UCL injury by analyzing online pitcher data.

    <title>Inferring Class Label Distribution of Training Data from Classifiers: An
  Accuracy-Augmented Meta-Classifier Attack</title>
    <summary>  Property inference attacks against machine learning (ML) models aim to infer
properties of the training data that are unrelated to the primary task of the
model, and have so far been formulated as binary decision problems, i.e.,
whether or not the training data have a certain property. However, in
industrial and healthcare applications, the proportion of labels in the
training data is quite often also considered sensitive information. In this
paper we introduce a new type of property inference attack that unlike binary
decision problems in literature, aim at inferring the class label distribution
of the training data from parameters of ML classifier models. We propose a
method based on \emph{shadow training} and a \emph{meta-classifier} trained on
the parameters of the shadow classifiers augmented with the accuracy of the
classifiers on auxiliary data. We evaluate the proposed approach for ML
classifiers with fully connected neural network architectures. We find that the
proposed \emph{meta-classifier} attack provides a maximum relative improvement
of $52\%$ over state of the art.

    <title>Model Evaluation in Medical Datasets Over Time</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning models deployed in healthcare systems face data drawn from
continually evolving environments. However, researchers proposing such models
typically evaluate them in a time-agnostic manner, with train and test splits
sampling patients throughout the entire study period. We introduce the
Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time (EMDOT) framework and Python package,
which evaluates the performance of a model class over time. Across five medical
datasets and a variety of models, we compare two training strategies: (1) using
all historical data, and (2) using a window of the most recent data. We note
changes in performance over time, and identify possible explanations for these
shocks.

    <title>Diffsurv: Differentiable sorting for censored time-to-event data</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis is a crucial semi-supervised task in machine learning with
numerous real-world applications, particularly in healthcare. Currently, the
most common approach to survival analysis is based on Cox's partial likelihood,
which can be interpreted as a ranking model optimized on a lower bound of the
concordance index. This relation between ranking models and Cox's partial
likelihood considers only pairwise comparisons. Recent work has developed
differentiable sorting methods which relax this pairwise independence
assumption, enabling the ranking of sets of samples. However, current
differentiable sorting methods cannot account for censoring, a key factor in
many real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method
called Diffsurv. We extend differentiable sorting methods to handle censored
tasks by predicting matrices of possible permutations that take into account
the label uncertainty introduced by censored samples. We contrast this approach
with methods derived from partial likelihood and ranking losses. Our
experiments show that Diffsurv outperforms established baselines in various
simulated and real-world risk prediction scenarios. Additionally, we
demonstrate the benefits of the algorithmic supervision enabled by Diffsurv by
presenting a novel method for top-k risk prediction that outperforms current
methods.

    <title>AutoCure: Automated Tabular Data Curation Technique for ML Pipelines</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly prevalent in multiple
domains, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. In such domains,
data preparation remains a significant challenge in developing accurate models,
requiring significant expertise and time investment to search the huge search
space of well-suited data curation and transformation tools. To address this
challenge, we present AutoCure, a novel and configuration-free data curation
pipeline that improves the quality of tabular data. Unlike traditional data
curation methods, AutoCure synthetically enhances the density of the clean data
fraction through an adaptive ensemble-based error detection method and a data
augmentation module. In practice, AutoCure can be integrated with open source
tools, e.g., Auto-sklearn, H2O, and TPOT, to promote the democratization of
machine learning. As a proof of concept, we provide a comparative evaluation of
AutoCure against 28 combinations of traditional data curation tools,
demonstrating superior performance and predictive accuracy without user
intervention. Our evaluation shows that AutoCure is an effective approach to
automating data preparation and improving the accuracy of machine learning
models.

    <title>Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones</title>
    <summary>  Human Activity Recognition is a subject of great research today and has its
applications in remote healthcare, activity tracking of the elderly or the
disables, calories burnt tracking etc. In our project, we have created an
Android application that recognizes the daily human activities and calculate
the calories burnt in real time. We first captured labeled triaxial
acceleration readings for different daily human activities from the
smartphone's embedded accelerometer. These readings were preprocessed using a
median filter. 42 features were extracted using various methods. We then tested
various machine learning algorithms along with dimensionality reduction.
Finally, in our Android application, we used the machine learning algorithm and
a subset of features that provided maximum accuracy and minimum model building
time. This is used for real-time activity recognition and calculation of
calories burnt using a formula based on Metabolic Equivalent.

    <title>CHEER: Rich Model Helps Poor Model via Knowledge Infusion</title>
    <summary>  There is a growing interest in applying deep learning (DL) to healthcare,
driven by the availability of data with multiple feature channels in rich-data
environments (e.g., intensive care units). However, in many other practical
situations, we can only access data with much fewer feature channels in a
poor-data environments (e.g., at home), which often results in predictive
models with poor performance. How can we boost the performance of models
learned from such poor-data environment by leveraging knowledge extracted from
existing models trained using rich data in a related environment? To address
this question, we develop a knowledge infusion framework named CHEER that can
succinctly summarize such rich model into transferable representations, which
can be incorporated into the poor model to improve its performance. The infused
model is analyzed theoretically and evaluated empirically on several datasets.
Our empirical results showed that CHEER outperformed baselines by 5.60% to
46.80% in terms of the macro-F1 score on multiple physiological datasets.

    <title>Quantile Off-Policy Evaluation via Deep Conditional Generative Learning</title>
    <summary>  Off-Policy evaluation (OPE) is concerned with evaluating a new target policy
using offline data generated by a potentially different behavior policy. It is
critical in a number of sequential decision making problems ranging from
healthcare to technology industries. Most of the work in existing literature is
focused on evaluating the mean outcome of a given policy, and ignores the
variability of the outcome. However, in a variety of applications, criteria
other than the mean may be more sensible. For example, when the reward
distribution is skewed and asymmetric, quantile-based metrics are often
preferred for their robustness. In this paper, we propose a doubly-robust
inference procedure for quantile OPE in sequential decision making and study
its asymptotic properties. In particular, we propose utilizing state-of-the-art
deep conditional generative learning methods to handle parameter-dependent
nuisance function estimation. We demonstrate the advantages of this proposed
estimator through both simulations and a real-world dataset from a short-video
platform. In particular, we find that our proposed estimator outperforms
classical OPE estimators for the mean in settings with heavy-tailed reward
distributions.

    <title>Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a
fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic
predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it
has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that
they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for
individual data. In this work, we develop a principled framework to address
data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning
algorithm trained on $n$ data points to produce a predictor, we propose data
Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the
predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural
properties of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and
gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical
settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are
trained on large datasets. In addition to being equitable, extensive
experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic data demonstrate that data
Shapley has several other benefits: 1) it is more powerful than the popular
leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data is more
valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively
capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type
of new data to acquire to improve the predictor.

    <title>Leveraging Factored Action Spaces for Efficient Offline Reinforcement
  Learning in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Many reinforcement learning (RL) applications have combinatorial action
spaces, where each action is a composition of sub-actions. A standard RL
approach ignores this inherent factorization structure, resulting in a
potential failure to make meaningful inferences about rarely observed
sub-action combinations; this is particularly problematic for offline settings,
where data may be limited. In this work, we propose a form of linear Q-function
decomposition induced by factored action spaces. We study the theoretical
properties of our approach, identifying scenarios where it is guaranteed to
lead to zero bias when used to approximate the Q-function. Outside the regimes
with theoretical guarantees, we show that our approach can still be useful
because it leads to better sample efficiency without necessarily sacrificing
policy optimality, allowing us to achieve a better bias-variance trade-off.
Across several offline RL problems using simulators and real-world datasets
motivated by healthcare, we demonstrate that incorporating factored action
spaces into value-based RL can result in better-performing policies. Our
approach can help an agent make more accurate inferences within underexplored
regions of the state-action space when applying RL to observational datasets.

    <title>On Covariate Shift of Latent Confounders in Imitation and Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  We consider the problem of using expert data with unobserved confounders for
imitation and reinforcement learning. We begin by defining the problem of
learning from confounded expert data in a contextual MDP setup. We analyze the
limitations of learning from such data with and without external reward, and
propose an adjustment of standard imitation learning algorithms to fit this
setup. We then discuss the problem of distribution shift between the expert
data and the online environment when the data is only partially observable. We
prove possibility and impossibility results for imitation learning under
arbitrary distribution shift of the missing covariates. When additional
external reward is provided, we propose a sampling procedure that addresses the
unknown shift and prove convergence to an optimal solution. Finally, we
validate our claims empirically on challenging assistive healthcare and
recommender system simulation tasks.

    <title>FeSViBS: Federated Split Learning of Vision Transformer with Block
  Sampling</title>
    <summary>  Data scarcity is a significant obstacle hindering the learning of powerful
machine learning models in critical healthcare applications. Data-sharing
mechanisms among multiple entities (e.g., hospitals) can accelerate model
training and yield more accurate predictions. Recently, approaches such as
Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) have facilitated collaboration
without the need to exchange private data. In this work, we propose a framework
for medical imaging classification tasks called Federated Split learning of
Vision transformer with Block Sampling (FeSViBS). The FeSViBS framework builds
upon the existing federated split vision transformer and introduces a block
sampling module, which leverages intermediate features extracted by the Vision
Transformer (ViT) at the server. This is achieved by sampling features (patch
tokens) from an intermediate transformer block and distilling their information
content into a pseudo class token before passing them back to the client. These
pseudo class tokens serve as an effective feature augmentation strategy and
enhances the generalizability of the learned model. We demonstrate the utility
of our proposed method compared to other SL and FL approaches on three publicly
available medical imaging datasets: HAM1000, BloodMNIST, and Fed-ISIC2019,
under both IID and non-IID settings. Code:

    <title>Targeting Underrepresented Populations in Precision Medicine: A
  Federated Transfer Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  The limited representation of minorities and disadvantaged populations in
large-scale clinical and genomics research has become a barrier to translating
precision medicine research into practice. Due to heterogeneity across
populations, risk prediction models are often found to be underperformed in
these underrepresented populations, and therefore may further exacerbate known
health disparities. In this paper, we propose a two-way data integration
strategy that integrates heterogeneous data from diverse populations and from
multiple healthcare institutions via a federated transfer learning approach.
The proposed method can handle the challenging setting where sample sizes from
different populations are highly unbalanced. With only a small number of
communications across participating sites, the proposed method can achieve
performance comparable to the pooled analysis where individual-level data are
directly pooled together. We show that the proposed method improves the
estimation and prediction accuracy in underrepresented populations, and reduces
the gap of model performance across populations. Our theoretical analysis
reveals how estimation accuracy is influenced by communication budgets, privacy
restrictions, and heterogeneity across populations. We demonstrate the
feasibility and validity of our methods through numerical experiments and a
real application to a multi-center study, in which we construct polygenic risk
prediction models for Type II diabetes in AA population.

    <title>Using Apple Machine Learning Algorithms to Detect and Subclassify
  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
    <summary>  Lung cancer continues to be a major healthcare challenge with high morbidity
and mortality rates among both men and women worldwide. The majority of lung
cancer cases are of non-small cell lung cancer type. With the advent of
targeted cancer therapy, it is imperative not only to properly diagnose but
also sub-classify non-small cell lung cancer. In our study, we evaluated the
utility of using Apple Create ML module to detect and sub-classify non-small
cell carcinomas based on histopathological images. After module optimization,
the program detected 100% of non-small cell lung cancer images and successfully
subclassified the majority of the images. Trained modules, such as ours, can be
utilized in diagnostic smartphone-based applications, augmenting diagnostic
services in understaffed areas of the world.

    <title>Interpretation of Black Box NLP Models: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  An increasing number of machine learning models have been deployed in domains
with high stakes such as finance and healthcare. Despite their superior
performances, many models are black boxes in nature which are hard to explain.
There are growing efforts for researchers to develop methods to interpret these
black-box models. Post hoc explanations based on perturbations, such as LIME,
are widely used approaches to interpret a machine learning model after it has
been built. This class of methods has been shown to exhibit large instability,
posing serious challenges to the effectiveness of the method itself and harming
user trust. In this paper, we propose S-LIME, which utilizes a hypothesis
testing framework based on central limit theorem for determining the number of
perturbation points needed to guarantee stability of the resulting explanation.
Experiments on both simulated and real world data sets are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    <title>Mutation Testing framework for Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  This is an article or technical note which is intended to provides an insight
journey of Machine Learning Systems (MLS) testing, its evolution, current
paradigm and future work. Machine Learning Models, used in critical
applications such as healthcare industry, Automobile, and Air Traffic control,
Share Trading etc., and failure of ML Model can lead to severe consequences in
terms of loss of life or property. To remediate this, developers, scientists,
and ML community around the world, must build a highly reliable test
architecture for critical ML application. At the very foundation layer, any
test model must satisfy the core testing attributes such as test properties and
its components. This attribute comes from the software engineering, but the
same cannot be applied in as-is form to the ML testing and we will tell you
why.

    <title>Benchmarking Framework for Performance-Evaluation of Causal Inference
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Causal inference analysis is the estimation of the effects of actions on
outcomes. In the context of healthcare data this means estimating the outcome
of counter-factual treatments (i.e. including treatments that were not
observed) on a patient's outcome. Compared to classic machine learning methods,
evaluation and validation of causal inference analysis is more challenging
because ground truth data of counter-factual outcome can never be obtained in
any real-world scenario. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for
benchmarking algorithms that estimate causal effect. The framework includes
unlabeled data for prediction, labeled data for validation, and code for
automatic evaluation of algorithm predictions using both established and novel
metrics. The data is based on real-world covariates, and the treatment
assignments and outcomes are based on simulations, which provides the basis for
validation. In this framework we address two questions: one of scaling, and the
other of data-censoring. The framework is available as open source code at
https://github.com/IBM-HRL-MLHLS/IBM-Causal-Inference-Benchmarking-Framework

    <title>Predicting assisted ventilation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis using a
  mixture of experts and conformal predictors</title>
    <summary>  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease
characterized by a rapid motor decline, leading to respiratory failure and
subsequently to death. In this context, researchers have sought for models to
automatically predict disease progression to assisted ventilation in ALS
patients. However, the clinical translation of such models is limited by the
lack of insight 1) on the risk of error for predictions at patient-level, and
2) on the most adequate time to administer the non-invasive ventilation. To
address these issues, we combine Conformal Prediction (a machine learning
framework that complements predictions with confidence measures) and a mixture
experts into a prognostic model which not only predicts whether an ALS patient
will suffer from respiratory insufficiency but also the most likely time window
of occurrence, at a given reliability level. Promising results were obtained,
with near 80% of predictions being correctly identified.

    <title>Training without training data: Improving the generalizability of
  automated medical abbreviation disambiguation</title>
    <summary>  Abbreviation disambiguation is important for automated clinical note
processing due to the frequent use of abbreviations in clinical settings.
Current models for automated abbreviation disambiguation are restricted by the
scarcity and imbalance of labeled training data, decreasing their
generalizability to orthogonal sources. In this work we propose a novel data
augmentation technique that utilizes information from related medical concepts,
which improves our model's ability to generalize. Furthermore, we show that
incorporating the global context information within the whole medical note (in
addition to the traditional local context window), can significantly improve
the model's representation for abbreviations. We train our model on a public
dataset (MIMIC III) and test its performance on datasets from different sources
(CASI, i2b2). Together, these two techniques boost the accuracy of abbreviation
disambiguation by almost 14% on the CASI dataset and 4% on i2b2.

    <title>What went wrong and when? Instance-wise Feature Importance for
  Time-series Models</title>
    <summary>  Explanations of time series models are useful for high stakes applications
like healthcare but have received little attention in machine learning
literature. We propose FIT, a framework that evaluates the importance of
observations for a multivariate time-series black-box model by quantifying the
shift in the predictive distribution over time. FIT defines the importance of
an observation based on its contribution to the distributional shift under a
KL-divergence that contrasts the predictive distribution against a
counterfactual where the rest of the features are unobserved. We also
demonstrate the need to control for time-dependent distribution shifts. We
compare with state-of-the-art baselines on simulated and real-world clinical
data and demonstrate that our approach is superior in identifying important
time points and observations throughout the time series.

    <title>Speech-Based Emotion Recognition using Neural Networks and Information
  Visualization</title>
    <summary>  Emotions recognition is commonly employed for health assessment. However, the
typical metric for evaluation in therapy is based on patient-doctor appraisal.
This process can fall into the issue of subjectivity, while also requiring
healthcare professionals to deal with copious amounts of information. Thus,
machine learning algorithms can be a useful tool for the classification of
emotions. While several models have been developed in this domain, there is a
lack of userfriendly representations of the emotion classification systems for
therapy. We propose a tool which enables users to take speech samples and
identify a range of emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, clam,
disgust, and fear) from audio elements through a machine learning model. The
dashboard is designed based on local therapists' needs for intuitive
representations of speech data in order to gain insights and informative
analyses of their sessions with their patients.

    <title>A Deep Dive into Perturbations as Evaluation Technique for Time Series
  XAI</title>
    <summary>  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention
recently as the demand for transparency and interpretability of machine
learning models has increased. In particular, XAI for time series data has
become increasingly important in finance, healthcare, and climate science.
However, evaluating the quality of explanations, such as attributions provided
by XAI techniques, remains challenging. This paper provides an in-depth
analysis of using perturbations to evaluate attributions extracted from time
series models. A perturbation analysis involves systematically modifying the
input data and evaluating the impact on the attributions generated by the XAI
method. We apply this approach to several state-of-the-art XAI techniques and
evaluate their performance on three time series classification datasets. Our
results demonstrate that the perturbation analysis approach can effectively
evaluate the quality of attributions and provide insights into the strengths
and limitations of XAI techniques. Such an approach can guide the selection of
XAI methods for time series data, e.g., focusing on return time rather than
precision, and facilitate the development of more reliable and interpretable
machine learning models for time series analysis.

    <title>On Leakage in Machine Learning Pipelines</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools for predictive modeling. ML's
popularity stems from the promise of sample-level prediction with applications
across a variety of fields from physics and marketing to healthcare. However,
if not properly implemented and evaluated, ML pipelines may contain leakage
typically resulting in overoptimistic performance estimates and failure to
generalize to new data. This can have severe negative financial and societal
implications. Our aim is to expand understanding associated with causes leading
to leakage when designing, implementing, and evaluating ML pipelines.
Illustrated by concrete examples, we provide a comprehensive overview and
discussion of various types of leakage that may arise in ML pipelines.

    <title>MISS: Multiclass Interpretable Scoring Systems</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present a novel, machine-learning approach for constructing
Multiclass Interpretable Scoring Systems (MISS) - a fully data-driven
methodology for generating single, sparse, and user-friendly scoring systems
for multiclass classification problems. Scoring systems are commonly utilized
as decision support models in healthcare, criminal justice, and other domains
where interpretability of predictions and ease of use are crucial. Prior
methods for data-driven scoring, such as SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer
Model), were limited to binary classification tasks and extensions to
multiclass domains were primarily accomplished via one-versus-all-type
techniques. The scores produced by our method can be easily transformed into
class probabilities via the softmax function. We demonstrate techniques for
dimensionality reduction and heuristics that enhance the training efficiency
and decrease the optimality gap, a measure that can certify the optimality of
the model. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on datasets from various
domains, and the results indicate that it is competitive with other machine
learning models in terms of classification performance metrics and provides
well-calibrated class probabilities.

    <title>An Intelligent Decision Support Ensemble Voting Model for Coronary
  Artery Disease Prediction in Smart Healthcare Monitoring Environments</title>
    <summary>  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common cardiac diseases
worldwide and causes disability and economic burden. It is the world's leading
and most serious cause of mortality, with approximately 80% of deaths reported
in low- and middle-income countries. The preferred and most precise diagnostic
tool for CAD is angiography, but it is invasive, expensive, and technically
demanding. However, the research community is increasingly interested in the
computer-aided diagnosis of CAD via the utilization of machine learning (ML)
methods. The purpose of this work is to present an e-diagnosis tool based on ML
algorithms that can be used in a smart healthcare monitoring system. We applied
the most accurate machine learning methods that have shown superior results in
the literature to different medical datasets such as RandomForest, XGboost,
MLP, J48, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes, LogitBoost, KNN. Every single classifier can be
efficient on a different dataset. Thus, an ensemble model using majority voting
was designed to take advantage of the well-performed single classifiers,
Ensemble learning aims to combine the forecasts of multiple individual
classifiers to achieve higher performance than individual classifiers in terms
of precision, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy; furthermore, we have
benchmarked our proposed model with the most efficient and well-known ensemble
models, such as Bagging, Stacking methods based on the cross-validation
technique, The experimental results confirm that the ensemble majority voting
approach based on the top 3 classifiers: MultilayerPerceptron, RandomForest,
and AdaBoost, achieves the highest accuracy of 88,12% and outperforms all other
classifiers. This study demonstrates that the majority voting ensemble approach
proposed above is the most accurate machine learning classification approach
for the prediction and detection of coronary artery disease.

    <title>Predictive Analysis of Tuberculosis Treatment Outcomes Using Machine
  Learning: A Karnataka TB Data Study at a Scale</title>
    <summary>  Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat, ranking among the leading
causes of mortality worldwide. In this context, machine learning (ML) has
emerged as a transformative force, providing innovative solutions to the
complexities associated with TB treatment.This study explores how machine
learning, especially with tabular data, can be used to predict Tuberculosis
(TB) treatment outcomes more accurately. It transforms this prediction task
into a binary classification problem, generating risk scores from patient data
sourced from NIKSHAY, India's national TB control program, which includes over
500,000 patient records.
  Data preprocessing is a critical component of the study, and the model
achieved an recall of 98% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.95 on the validation set,
which includes 20,000 patient records.We also explore the use of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for improved model learning. Our results,
corroborated by various metrics and ablation studies, validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The study concludes by discussing the potential
ramifications of our research on TB eradication efforts and proposing potential
avenues for future work. This study marks a significant stride in the battle
against TB, showcasing the potential of machine learning in healthcare.

    <title>I-SIRch: AI-Powered Concept Annotation Tool For Equitable Extraction And
  Analysis Of Safety Insights From Maternity Investigations</title>
    <summary>  Maternity care is a complex system involving treatments and interactions
between patients, providers, and the care environment. To improve patient
safety and outcomes, understanding the human factors (e.g. individuals
decisions, local facilities) influencing healthcare delivery is crucial.
However, most current tools for analysing healthcare data focus only on
biomedical concepts (e.g. health conditions, procedures and tests), overlooking
the importance of human factors. We developed a new approach called I-SIRch,
using artificial intelligence to automatically identify and label human factors
concepts in maternity healthcare investigation reports describing adverse
maternity incidents produced by England's Healthcare Safety Investigation
Branch (HSIB). These incident investigation reports aim to identify
opportunities for learning and improving maternal safety across the entire
healthcare system. I-SIRch was trained using real data and tested on both real
and simulated data to evaluate its performance in identifying human factors
concepts. When applied to real reports, the model achieved a high level of
accuracy, correctly identifying relevant concepts in 90\% of the sentences from
97 reports. Applying I-SIRch to analyse these reports revealed that certain
human factors disproportionately affected mothers from different ethnic groups.
Our work demonstrates the potential of using automated tools to identify human
factors concepts in maternity incident investigation reports, rather than
focusing solely on biomedical concepts. This approach opens up new
possibilities for understanding the complex interplay between social,
technical, and organisational factors influencing maternal safety and
population health outcomes. By taking a more comprehensive view of maternal
healthcare delivery, we can develop targeted interventions to address
disparities and improve maternal outcomes.

    <title>Try to Avoid Attacks: A Federated Data Sanitization Defense for
  Healthcare IoMT Systems</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare IoMT systems are becoming intelligent, miniaturized, and more
integrated into daily life. As for the distributed devices in the IoMT,
federated learning has become a topical area with cloud-based training
procedures when meeting data security. However, the distribution of IoMT has
the risk of protection from data poisoning attacks. Poisoned data can be
fabricated by falsifying medical data, which urges a security defense to IoMT
systems. Due to the lack of specific labels, the filtering of malicious data is
a unique unsupervised scenario. One of the main challenges is finding robust
data filtering methods for various poisoning attacks. This paper introduces a
Federated Data Sanitization Defense, a novel approach to protect the system
from data poisoning attacks. To solve this unsupervised problem, we first use
federated learning to project all the data to the subspace domain, allowing
unified feature mapping to be established since the data is stored locally.
Then we adopt the federated clustering to re-group their features to clarify
the poisoned data. The clustering is based on the consistent association of
data and its semantics. After we get the clustering of the private data, we do
the data sanitization with a simple yet efficient strategy. In the end, each
device of distributed ImOT is enabled to filter malicious data according to
federated data sanitization. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate
the efficacy of the proposed defense method against data poisoning attacks.
Further, we consider our approach in the different poisoning ratios and achieve
a high Accuracy and a low attack success rate.

    <title>Prediction of Oral Food Challenge Outcomes via Ensemble Learning</title>
    <summary>  Oral Food Challenges (OFCs) are essential to accurately diagnosing food
allergy due to the limitations of existing clinical testing. However, some
patients are hesitant to undergo OFCs, while those willing suffer from limited
access to allergists in rural/community healthcare settings. Despite its
success in predicting patient outcomes in other clinical settings, few
applications of machine learning to food allergy have been developed. Thus, in
this study, we seek to leverage machine learning methodologies for OFC outcome
prediction. Retrospective data was gathered from 1,112 patients who
collectively underwent a total of 1,284 OFCs, and consisted of clinical factors
including serum-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE), total IgE, skin prick tests
(SPTs), comorbidities, sex, and age. Using these features, multiple machine
learning models were constructed to predict OFC outcomes for three common
allergens: peanut, egg, and milk. The best performing model for each allergen
was an ensemble of random forest (egg) or Learning Using Concave and Convex
Kernels (LUCCK) (peanut, milk) models, which achieved an Area under the Curve
(AUC) of 0.91, 0.96, and 0.94, in predicting OFC outcomes for peanut, egg, and
milk, respectively. Moreover, all such models had sensitivity and specificity
values 89%. Model interpretation via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
indicates that specific IgE, along with wheal and flare values from SPTs, are
highly predictive of OFC outcomes. The results of this analysis suggest that
ensemble learning has the potential to predict OFC outcomes and reveal relevant
clinical factors for further study.

    <title>Output-Constrained Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Bayesian neural network (BNN) priors are defined in parameter space, making
it hard to encode prior knowledge expressed in function space. We formulate a
prior that incorporates functional constraints about what the output can or
cannot be in regions of the input space. Output-Constrained BNNs (OC-BNN)
represent an interpretable approach of enforcing a range of constraints, fully
consistent with the Bayesian framework and amenable to black-box inference. We
demonstrate how OC-BNNs improve model robustness and prevent the prediction of
infeasible outputs in two real-world applications of healthcare and robotics.

    <title>Active Learning-Based Multistage Sequential Decision-Making Model with
  Application on Common Bile Duct Stone Evaluation</title>
    <summary>  Multistage sequential decision-making scenarios are commonly seen in the
healthcare diagnosis process. In this paper, an active learning-based method is
developed to actively collect only the necessary patient data in a sequential
manner. There are two novelties in the proposed method. First, unlike the
existing ordinal logistic regression model which only models a single stage, we
estimate the parameters for all stages together. Second, it is assumed that the
coefficients for common features in different stages are kept consistent. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in both a simulation study
and a real case study. Compared with the baseline method where the data is
modeled individually and independently, the proposed method improves the
estimation efficiency by 62\%-1838\%. For both simulation and testing cohorts,
the proposed method is more effective, stable, interpretable, and
computationally efficient on parameter estimation. The proposed method can be
easily extended to a variety of scenarios where decision-making can be done
sequentially with only necessary information.

    <title>Federated Learning in Multi-Center Critical Care Research: A Systematic
  Case Study using the eICU Database</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a method to train a model on
different units without exchanging data. This offers great opportunities in the
healthcare sector, where large datasets are available but cannot be shared to
ensure patient privacy. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of FL
on the publicly available eICU dataset for predicting the survival of each ICU
stay. We employ Federated Averaging as the main practical algorithm for FL and
show how its performance changes by altering three key hyper-parameters, taking
into account that clients can significantly vary in size. We find that in many
settings, a large number of local training epochs improves the performance
while at the same time reducing communication costs. Furthermore, we outline in
which settings it is possible to have only a low number of hospitals
participating in each federated update round. When many hospitals with low
patient counts are involved, the effect of overfitting can be avoided by
decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying
suitable settings for running distributed algorithms such as FL on clinical
datasets.

    <title>Bayesian approaches for Quantifying Clinicians' Variability in Medical
  Image Quantification</title>
    <summary>  Medical imaging, including MRI, CT, and Ultrasound, plays a vital role in
clinical decisions. Accurate segmentation is essential to measure the structure
of interest from the image. However, manual segmentation is highly
operator-dependent, which leads to high inter and intra-variability of
quantitative measurements. In this paper, we explore the feasibility that
Bayesian predictive distribution parameterized by deep neural networks can
capture the clinicians' inter-intra variability. By exploring and analyzing
recently emerged approximate inference schemes, we evaluate whether approximate
Bayesian deep learning with the posterior over segmentations can learn
inter-intra rater variability both in segmentation and clinical measurements.
The experiments are performed with two different imaging modalities: MRI and
ultrasound. We empirically demonstrated that Bayesian predictive distribution
parameterized by deep neural networks could approximate the clinicians'
inter-intra variability. We show a new perspective in analyzing medical images
quantitatively by providing clinical measurement uncertainty.

    <title>Defect Analysis of 3D Printed Cylinder Object Using Transfer Learning
  Approaches</title>
    <summary>  Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining attention across various industries
like healthcare, aerospace, and automotive. However, identifying defects early
in the AM process can reduce production costs and improve productivity - a key
challenge. This study explored the effectiveness of machine learning (ML)
approaches, specifically transfer learning (TL) models, for defect detection in
3D-printed cylinders. Images of cylinders were analyzed using models including
VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionResNetV2, and MobileNetV2.
Performance was compared across two datasets using accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score metrics. In the first study, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, and
MobileNetV2 achieved perfect scores. In contrast, ResNet50 had the lowest
performance, with an average F1-score of 0.32. Similarly, in the second study,
MobileNetV2 correctly classified all instances, while ResNet50 struggled with
more false positives and fewer true positives, resulting in an F1-score of
0.75. Overall, the findings suggest certain TL models like MobileNetV2 can
deliver high accuracy for AM defect classification, although performance varies
across algorithms. The results provide insights into model optimization and
integration needs for reliable automated defect analysis during 3D printing. By
identifying the top-performing TL techniques, this study aims to enhance AM
product quality through robust image-based monitoring and inspection.

    <title>Rethinking multiscale cardiac electrophysiology with machine learning
  and predictive modelling</title>
    <summary>  We review some of the latest approaches to analysing cardiac
electrophysiology data using machine learning and predictive modelling. Cardiac
arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, are a major global healthcare
challenge. Treatment is often through catheter ablation, which involves the
targeted localized destruction of regions of the myocardium responsible for
initiating or perpetuating the arrhythmia. Ablation targets are either
anatomically defined, or identified based on their functional properties as
determined through the analysis of contact intracardiac electrograms acquired
with increasing spatial density by modern electroanatomic mapping systems.
While numerous quantitative approaches have been investigated over the past
decades for identifying these critical curative sites, few have provided a
reliable and reproducible advance in success rates. Machine learning
techniques, including recent deep-learning approaches, offer a potential route
to gaining new insight from this wealth of highly complex spatio-temporal
information that existing methods struggle to analyse. Coupled with predictive
modelling, these techniques offer exciting opportunities to advance the field
and produce more accurate diagnoses and robust personalised treatment. We
outline some of these methods and illustrate their use in making predictions
from the contact electrogram and augmenting predictive modelling tools, both by
more rapidly predicting future states of the system and by inferring the
parameters of these models from experimental observations.

    <summary>  We propose an agile softwarized infrastructure for flexible, cost effective,
secure and privacy preserving deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) for smart
healthcare applications and services. It integrates state-of-the-art networking
and virtualization techniques across IoT, fog and cloud domains, employing
Blockchain, Tor and message brokers to provide security and privacy for
patients and healthcare providers. We propose a novel platform using
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) messaging and rule-based beacons for seamless data
management and discuss the role of data and decision fusion in the cloud and
the fog, respectively, for smart healthcare applications and services.

    <title>A Large Scale Benchmark for Individual Treatment Effect Prediction and
  Uplift Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) prediction is an important area of research
in machine learning which aims at explaining and estimating the causal impact
of an action at the granular level. It represents a problem of growing interest
in multiple sectors of application such as healthcare, online advertising or
socioeconomics. To foster research on this topic we release a publicly
available collection of 13.9 million samples collected from several randomized
control trials, scaling up previously available datasets by a healthy 210x
factor. We provide details on the data collection and perform sanity checks to
validate the use of this data for causal inference tasks. First, we formalize
the task of uplift modeling (UM) that can be performed with this data, along
with the relevant evaluation metrics. Then, we propose synthetic response
surfaces and heterogeneous treatment assignment providing a general set-up for
ITE prediction. Finally, we report experiments to validate key characteristics
of the dataset leveraging its size to evaluate and compare - with high
statistical significance - a selection of baseline UM and ITE prediction
methods.

    <title>A Data-Centric Behavioral Machine Learning Platform to Reduce Health
  Inequalities</title>
    <summary>  Providing front-line health workers in low- and middle- income countries with
recommendations and predictions to improve health outcomes can have a
tremendous impact on reducing healthcare inequalities, for instance by helping
to prevent the thousands of maternal and newborn deaths that occur every day.
To that end, we are developing a data-centric machine learning platform that
leverages the behavioral logs from a wide range of mobile health applications
running in those countries. Here we describe the platform architecture,
focusing on the details that help us to maximize the quality and organization
of the data throughout the whole process, from the data ingestion with a
data-science purposed software development kit to the data pipelines, feature
engineering and model management.

    <title>Before and After: Machine learning for perioperative patient care</title>
    <summary>  For centuries nursing has been known as a job that requires complex manual
operations, that cannot be automated or replaced by any machinery. All the
devices and techniques have been invented only to support, but never fully
replace, a person with knowledge and expert intuition. With the rise of
Artificial Intelligence and continuously increasing digital data flow in
healthcare, new tools have arrived to improve patient care and reduce the
labour-intensive work conditions of a nurse.
  This cross-disciplinary review aims to build a bridge over the gap between
computer science and nursing. It outlines and classifies the methods for
machine learning and data processing in patient care before and after the
operation. It comprises of Process-, Patient-, Operator-, Feedback-, and
Technology-centric classifications. The presented classifications are based on
the technical aspects of patient case.

    <title>A Holistic Assessment of the Reliability of Machine Learning Systems</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning (ML) systems increasingly permeate high-stakes settings
such as healthcare, transportation, military, and national security, concerns
regarding their reliability have emerged. Despite notable progress, the
performance of these systems can significantly diminish due to adversarial
attacks or environmental changes, leading to overconfident predictions,
failures to detect input faults, and an inability to generalize in unexpected
scenarios. This paper proposes a holistic assessment methodology for the
reliability of ML systems. Our framework evaluates five key properties:
in-distribution accuracy, distribution-shift robustness, adversarial
robustness, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection. A reliability score
is also introduced and used to assess the overall system reliability. To
provide insights into the performance of different algorithmic approaches, we
identify and categorize state-of-the-art techniques, then evaluate a selection
on real-world tasks using our proposed reliability metrics and reliability
score. Our analysis of over 500 models reveals that designing for one metric
does not necessarily constrain others but certain algorithmic techniques can
improve reliability across multiple metrics simultaneously. This study
contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of ML reliability and
provides a roadmap for future research and development.

    <title>Biomarker based Cancer Classification using an Ensemble with Pre-trained
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Certain cancer types, namely pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect at an
early stage; sparking the importance of discovering the causal relationship
between biomarkers and cancer to identify cancer efficiently. By allowing for
the detection and monitoring of specific biomarkers through a non-invasive
method, liquid biopsies enhance the precision and efficacy of medical
interventions, advocating the move towards personalized healthcare. Several
machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM are utilized for
classification, yet causing inefficiency due to the need for conducting
hyperparameter tuning. We leverage a meta-trained Hyperfast model for
classifying cancer, accomplishing the highest AUC of 0.9929 and simultaneously
achieving robustness especially on highly imbalanced datasets compared to other
ML algorithms in several binary classification tasks (e.g. breast invasive
carcinoma; BRCA vs. non-BRCA). We also propose a novel ensemble model combining
pre-trained Hyperfast model, XGBoost, and LightGBM for multi-class
classification tasks, achieving an incremental increase in accuracy (0.9464)
while merely using 500 PCA features; distinguishable from previous studies
where they used more than 2,000 features for similar results.

    <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Infinite-armed Linear Contextual Bandits</title>
    <summary>  Linear contextual bandit is an important class of sequential decision making
problems with a wide range of applications to recommender systems, online
advertising, healthcare, and many other machine learning related tasks. While
there is a lot of prior research, tight regret bounds of linear contextual
bandit with infinite action sets remain open. In this paper, we address this
open problem by considering the linear contextual bandit with (changing)
infinite action sets. We prove a regret upper bound on the order of
$O(\sqrt{d^2T\log T})\times \text{poly}(\log\log T)$ where $d$ is the domain
dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. Our upper bound matches the previous
lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d^2 T\log T})$ in [Li et al., 2019] up to iterated
logarithmic terms.

    <title>An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Assess the ZIP Code Level
  Impact of COVID-19 in NYC</title>
    <summary>  New York City has been recognized as the world's epicenter of the novel
Coronavirus pandemic. To identify the key inherent factors that are highly
correlated to the Increase Rate of COVID-19 new cases in NYC, we propose an
unsupervised machine learning framework. Based on the assumption that ZIP code
areas with similar demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility patterns are likely
to experience similar outbreaks, we select the most relevant features to
perform a clustering that can best reflect the spread, and map them down to 9
interpretable categories. We believe that our findings can guide policy makers
to promptly anticipate and prevent the spread of the virus by taking the right
measures.

    <title>Beyond Importance Scores: Interpreting Tabular ML by Visualizing Feature
  Semantics</title>
    <summary>  Interpretability is becoming an active research topic as machine learning
(ML) models are more widely used to make critical decisions. Tabular data is
one of the most commonly used modes of data in diverse applications such as
healthcare and finance. Much of the existing interpretability methods used for
tabular data only report feature-importance scores -- either locally (per
example) or globally (per model) -- but they do not provide interpretation or
visualization of how the features interact. We address this limitation by
introducing Feature Vectors, a new global interpretability method designed for
tabular datasets. In addition to providing feature-importance, Feature Vectors
discovers the inherent semantic relationship among features via an intuitive
feature visualization technique. Our systematic experiments demonstrate the
empirical utility of this new method by applying it to several real-world
datasets. We further provide an easy-to-use Python package for Feature Vectors.

    <title>Synthetic learner: model-free inference on treatments over time</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the effect of a particular treatment or a policy pertains to
many areas of interest, ranging from political economics, marketing to
healthcare. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric algorithm for detecting
the effects of treatment over time in the context of Synthetic Controls. The
method builds on counterfactual predictions from many algorithms without
necessarily assuming that the algorithms correctly capture the model. We
introduce an inferential procedure for detecting treatment effects and show
that the testing procedure is asymptotically valid for stationary, beta mixing
processes without imposing any restriction on the set of base algorithms under
consideration. We discuss consistency guarantees for average treatment effect
estimates and derive regret bounds for the proposed methodology. The class of
algorithms may include Random Forest, Lasso, or any other machine-learning
estimator. Numerical studies and an application illustrate the advantages of
the method.

    <title>Machine Learning Towards Intelligent Systems: Applications, Challenges,
  and Opportunities</title>
    <summary>  The emergence and continued reliance on the Internet and related technologies
has resulted in the generation of large amounts of data that can be made
available for analyses. However, humans do not possess the cognitive
capabilities to understand such large amounts of data. Machine learning (ML)
provides a mechanism for humans to process large amounts of data, gain insights
about the behavior of the data, and make more informed decision based on the
resulting analysis. ML has applications in various fields. This review focuses
on some of the fields and applications such as education, healthcare, network
security, banking and finance, and social media. Within these fields, there are
multiple unique challenges that exist. However, ML can provide solutions to
these challenges, as well as create further research opportunities.
Accordingly, this work surveys some of the challenges facing the aforementioned
fields and presents some of the previous literature works that tackled them.
Moreover, it suggests several research opportunities that benefit from the use
of ML to address these challenges.

    <title>A Scalable AI Approach for Clinical Trial Cohort Optimization</title>
    <summary>  FDA has been promoting enrollment practices that could enhance the diversity
of clinical trial populations, through broadening eligibility criteria.
However, how to broaden eligibility remains a significant challenge. We propose
an AI approach to Cohort Optimization (AICO) through transformer-based natural
language processing of the eligibility criteria and evaluation of the criteria
using real-world data. The method can extract common eligibility criteria
variables from a large set of relevant trials and measure the generalizability
of trial designs to real-world patients. It overcomes the scalability limits of
existing manual methods and enables rapid simulation of eligibility criteria
design for a disease of interest. A case study on breast cancer trial design
demonstrates the utility of the method in improving trial generalizability.

    <title>Survival Mixture Density Networks</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis, the art of time-to-event modeling, plays an important role
in clinical treatment decisions. Recently, continuous time models built from
neural ODEs have been proposed for survival analysis. However, the training of
neural ODEs is slow due to the high computational complexity of neural ODE
solvers. Here, we propose an efficient alternative for flexible continuous time
models, called Survival Mixture Density Networks (Survival MDNs). Survival MDN
applies an invertible positive function to the output of Mixture Density
Networks (MDNs). While MDNs produce flexible real-valued distributions, the
invertible positive function maps the model into the time-domain while
preserving a tractable density. Using four datasets, we show that Survival MDN
performs better than, or similarly to continuous and discrete time baselines on
concordance, integrated Brier score and integrated binomial log-likelihood.
Meanwhile, Survival MDNs are also faster than ODE-based models and circumvent
binning issues in discrete models.

including healthcare, biomedicine, and public health. Two submission tracks
were offered: the archival Proceedings track, and the non-archival Findings
track. Proceedings were targeted at mature work with strong technical
sophistication and a high impact to health. The Findings track looked for new
ideas that could spark insightful discussion, serve as valuable resources for
the community, or could enable new collaborations. Submissions to the
Proceedings track, if not accepted, were automatically considered for the
Findings track. All the manuscripts submitted to ML4H Symposium underwent a
double-blind peer-review process.

    <title>PMFL: Partial Meta-Federated Learning for heterogeneous tasks and its
  applications on real-world medical records</title>
    <summary>  Federated machine learning is a versatile and flexible tool to utilize
distributed data from different sources, especially when communication
technology develops rapidly and an unprecedented amount of data could be
collected on mobile devices nowadays. Federated learning method exploits not
only the data but the computational power of all devices in the network to
achieve more efficient model training. Nevertheless, while most traditional
federated learning methods work well for homogeneous data and tasks, adapting
the method to a different heterogeneous data and task distribution is
challenging. This limitation has constrained the applications of federated
learning in real-world contexts, especially in healthcare settings. Inspired by
the fundamental idea of meta-learning, in this study we propose a new
algorithm, which is an integration of federated learning and meta-learning, to
tackle this issue. In addition, owing to the advantage of transfer learning for
model generalization, we further improve our algorithm by introducing partial
parameter sharing. We name this method partial meta-federated learning (PMFL).
Finally, we apply the algorithms to two medical datasets. We show that our
algorithm could obtain the fastest training speed and achieve the best
performance when dealing with heterogeneous medical datasets.

    <title>Invariant Causal Imitation Learning for Generalizable Policies</title>
    <summary>  Consider learning an imitation policy on the basis of demonstrated behavior
from multiple environments, with an eye towards deployment in an unseen
environment. Since the observable features from each setting may be different,
directly learning individual policies as mappings from features to actions is
prone to spurious correlations -- and may not generalize well. However, the
expert's policy is often a function of a shared latent structure underlying
those observable features that is invariant across settings. By leveraging data
from multiple environments, we propose Invariant Causal Imitation Learning
(ICIL), a novel technique in which we learn a feature representation that is
invariant across domains, on the basis of which we learn an imitation policy
that matches expert behavior. To cope with transition dynamics mismatch, ICIL
learns a shared representation of causal features (for all training
environments), that is disentangled from the specific representations of noise
variables (for each of those environments). Moreover, to ensure that the
learned policy matches the observation distribution of the expert's policy,
ICIL estimates the energy of the expert's observations and uses a
regularization term that minimizes the imitator policy's next state energy.
Experimentally, we compare our methods against several benchmarks in control
and healthcare tasks and show its effectiveness in learning imitation policies
capable of generalizing to unseen environments.

    <title>Automated Contrastive Learning Strategy Search for Time Series</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, Contrastive Learning (CL) has become a predominant
representation learning paradigm for time series. Most existing methods in the
literature focus on manually building specific Contrastive Learning Strategies
(CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually
developing CLS usually require excessive prior knowledge about the datasets and
tasks, e.g., professional cognition of the medical time series in healthcare,
as well as huge human labor and massive experiments to determine the detailed
learning configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns to
contrastively learn representations for various time series datasets and tasks,
namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled
universal search space of size over 3x1012, covering data augmentation,
embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction and contrastive losses.
Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which
optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain more
effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world
tasks and datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the
suitable CLS for a given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by
AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally
Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also
provide empirical analysis as a guidance for future design of CLS.

    <title>Handling missing values in healthcare data: A systematic review of deep
  learning-based imputation techniques</title>
    <summary>  Objective: The proper handling of missing values is critical to delivering
reliable estimates and decisions, especially in high-stakes fields such as
clinical research. The increasing diversity and complexity of data have led
many researchers to develop deep learning (DL)-based imputation techniques. We
conducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of these techniques, with a
particular focus on data types, aiming to assist healthcare researchers from
various disciplines in dealing with missing values.
  Methods: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL,
and Scopus) for articles published prior to August 2021 that applied DL-based
models to imputation. We assessed selected publications from four perspectives:
health data types, model backbone (i.e., main architecture), imputation
strategies, and comparison with non-DL-based methods. Based on data types, we
created an evidence map to illustrate the adoption of DL models.
  Results: We included 64 articles, of which tabular static (26.6%, 17/64) and
temporal data (37.5%, 24/64) were the most frequently investigated. We found
that model backbone(s) differed among data types as well as the imputation
strategy. The "integrated" strategy, that is, the imputation task being solved
concurrently with downstream tasks, was popular for tabular temporal (50%,
12/24) and multi-modal data (71.4%, 5/7), but limited for other data types.
Moreover, DL-based imputation methods yielded better imputation accuracy in
most studies, compared with non-DL-based methods.
  Conclusion: DL-based imputation models can be customized based on data type,
addressing the corresponding missing patterns, and its associated "integrated"
strategy can enhance the efficacy of imputation, especially in scenarios where
data is complex. Future research may focus on the portability and fairness of
DL-based models for healthcare data imputation.

    <title>Online Transfer Learning for RSV Case Detection</title>
    <summary>  Transfer learning has become a pivotal technique in machine learning and has
proven to be effective in various real-world applications. However, utilizing
this technique for classification tasks with sequential data often faces
challenges, primarily attributed to the scarcity of class labels. To address
this challenge, we introduce Multi-Source Adaptive Weighting (MSAW), an online
multi-source transfer learning method. MSAW integrates a dynamic weighting
mechanism into an ensemble framework, enabling automatic adjustment of weights
based on the relevance and contribution of each source (representing historical
knowledge) and target model (learning from newly acquired data). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of MSAW by applying it to detect Respiratory Syncytial Virus
cases within Emergency Department visits, utilizing multiple years of
electronic health records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Our
method demonstrates performance improvements over many baselines, including
refining pre-trained models with online learning as well as three static
weighting approaches, showing MSAW's capacity to integrate historical knowledge
with progressively accumulated new data. This study indicates the potential of
online transfer learning in healthcare, particularly for developing machine
learning models that dynamically adapt to evolving situations where new data is
incrementally accumulated.

    <title>Fairness Violations and Mitigation under Covariate Shift</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of learning fair prediction models for unseen test sets
distributed differently from the train set. Stability against changes in data
distribution is an important mandate for responsible deployment of models. The
domain adaptation literature addresses this concern, albeit with the notion of
stability limited to that of prediction accuracy. We identify sufficient
conditions under which stable models, both in terms of prediction accuracy and
fairness, can be learned. Using the causal graph describing the data and the
anticipated shifts, we specify an approach based on feature selection that
exploits conditional independencies in the data to estimate accuracy and
fairness metrics for the test set. We show that for specific fairness
definitions, the resulting model satisfies a form of worst-case optimality. In
context of a healthcare task, we illustrate the advantages of the approach in
making more equitable decisions.

    <title>Inferring Lexicographically-Ordered Rewards from Preferences</title>
    <summary>  Modeling the preferences of agents over a set of alternatives is a principal
concern in many areas. The dominant approach has been to find a single
reward/utility function with the property that alternatives yielding higher
rewards are preferred over alternatives yielding lower rewards. However, in
many settings, preferences are based on multiple, often competing, objectives;
a single reward function is not adequate to represent such preferences. This
paper proposes a method for inferring multi-objective reward-based
representations of an agent's observed preferences. We model the agent's
priorities over different objectives as entering lexicographically, so that
objectives with lower priorities matter only when the agent is indifferent with
respect to objectives with higher priorities. We offer two example applications
in healthcare, one inspired by cancer treatment, the other inspired by organ
transplantation, to illustrate how the lexicographically-ordered rewards we
learn can provide a better understanding of a decision-maker's preferences and
help improve policies when used in reinforcement learning.

    <title>Mitigating Label Bias via Decoupled Confident Learning</title>
    <summary>  Growing concerns regarding algorithmic fairness have led to a surge in
methodologies to mitigate algorithmic bias. However, such methodologies largely
assume that observed labels in training data are correct. This is problematic
because bias in labels is pervasive across important domains, including
healthcare, hiring, and content moderation. In particular, human-generated
labels are prone to encoding societal biases. While the presence of labeling
bias has been discussed conceptually, there is a lack of methodologies to
address this problem. We propose a pruning method -- Decoupled Confident
Learning (DeCoLe) -- specifically designed to mitigate label bias. After
illustrating its performance on a synthetic dataset, we apply DeCoLe in the
context of hate speech detection, where label bias has been recognized as an
important challenge, and show that it successfully identifies biased labels and
outperforms competing approaches.

    <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Brain Tumor Classification and Segmentation
  Using a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation and
classification model using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that includes a
multiscale approach. One of the differences of our proposal with respect to
previous works is that input images are processed in three spatial scales along
different processing pathways. This mechanism is inspired in the inherent
operation of the Human Visual System. The proposed neural model can analyze MRI
images containing three types of tumors: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary
tumor, over sagittal, coronal, and axial views and does not need preprocessing
of input images to remove skull or vertebral column parts in advance. The
performance of our method on a publicly available MRI image dataset of 3064
slices from 233 patients is compared with previously classical machine learning
and deep learning published methods. In the comparison, our method remarkably
obtained a tumor classification accuracy of 0.973, higher than the other
approaches using the same database.

    <title>Data-Driven Knowledge Transfer in Batch $Q^*$ Learning</title>
    <summary>  In data-driven decision-making in marketing, healthcare, and education, it is
desirable to utilize a large amount of data from existing ventures to navigate
high-dimensional feature spaces and address data scarcity in new ventures. We
explore knowledge transfer in dynamic decision-making by concentrating on batch
stationary environments and formally defining task discrepancies through the
lens of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We propose a framework of Transferred
Fitted $Q$-Iteration algorithm with general function approximation, enabling
the direct estimation of the optimal action-state function $Q^*$ using both
target and source data. We establish the relationship between statistical
performance and MDP task discrepancy under sieve approximation, shedding light
on the impact of source and target sample sizes and task discrepancy on the
effectiveness of knowledge transfer. We show that the final learning error of
the $Q^*$ function is significantly improved from the single task rate both
theoretically and empirically.

    <title>Active learning for medical code assignment</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) is widely used to automatically extract meaningful
information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) to support operational,
clinical, and financial decision-making. However, ML models require a large
number of annotated examples to provide satisfactory results, which is not
possible in most healthcare scenarios due to the high cost of clinician-labeled
data. Active Learning (AL) is a process of selecting the most informative
instances to be labeled by an expert to further train a supervised algorithm.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of AL in multi-label text classification in
the clinical domain. In this context, we apply a set of well-known AL methods
to help automatically assign ICD-9 codes on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our results
show that the selection of informative instances provides satisfactory
classification with a significantly reduced training set (8.3\% of the total
instances). We conclude that AL methods can significantly reduce the manual
annotation cost while preserving model performance.

    <title>Outlier Detection using Self-Organizing Maps for Automated Blood Cell
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The quality of datasets plays a crucial role in the successful training and
deployment of deep learning models. Especially in the medical field, where
system performance may impact the health of patients, clean datasets are a
safety requirement for reliable predictions. Therefore, outlier detection is an
essential process when building autonomous clinical decision systems. In this
work, we assess the suitability of Self-Organizing Maps for outlier detection
specifically on a medical dataset containing quantitative phase images of white
blood cells. We detect and evaluate outliers based on quantization errors and
distance maps. Our findings confirm the suitability of Self-Organizing Maps for
unsupervised Out-Of-Distribution detection on the dataset at hand.
Self-Organizing Maps perform on par with a manually specified filter based on
expert domain knowledge. Additionally, they show promise as a tool in the
exploration and cleaning of medical datasets. As a direction for future
research, we suggest a combination of Self-Organizing Maps and feature
extraction based on deep learning.

    <title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Estimating Long-term Treatment
  Effects</title>
    <summary>  Randomized experiments (a.k.a. A/B tests) are a powerful tool for estimating
treatment effects, to inform decisions making in business, healthcare and other
applications. In many problems, the treatment has a lasting effect that evolves
over time. A limitation with randomized experiments is that they do not easily
extend to measure long-term effects, since running long experiments is
time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we take a reinforcement learning
(RL) approach that estimates the average reward in a Markov process. Motivated
by real-world scenarios where the observed state transition is nonstationary,
we develop a new algorithm for a class of nonstationary problems, and
demonstrate promising results in two synthetic datasets and one online store
dataset.

    <title>Autonomous Mobile Clinics: Empowering Affordable Anywhere Anytime
  Healthcare Access</title>
    <summary>  We are facing a global healthcare crisis today as the healthcare cost is ever
climbing, but with the aging population, government fiscal revenue is ever
dropping. To create a more efficient and effective healthcare system, three
technical challenges immediately present themselves: healthcare access,
healthcare equity, and healthcare efficiency. An autonomous mobile clinic
solves the healthcare access problem by bringing healthcare services to the
patient by the order of the patient's fingertips. Nevertheless, to enable a
universal autonomous mobile clinic network, a three-stage technical roadmap
needs to be achieved: In stage one, we focus on solving the inequity challenge
in the existing healthcare system by combining autonomous mobility and
telemedicine. In stage two, we develop an AI doctor for primary care, which we
foster from infancy to adulthood with clean healthcare data. With the AI
doctor, we can solve the inefficiency problem. In stage three, after we have
proven that the autonomous mobile clinic network can truly solve the target
clinical use cases, we shall open up the platform for all medical verticals,
thus enabling universal healthcare through this whole new system.

    <title>Robust and Interpretable Medical Image Classifiers via Concept
  Bottleneck Models</title>
    <summary>  Medical image classification is a critical problem for healthcare, with the
potential to alleviate the workload of doctors and facilitate diagnoses of
patients. However, two challenges arise when deploying deep learning models to
real-world healthcare applications. First, neural models tend to learn spurious
correlations instead of desired features, which could fall short when
generalizing to new domains (e.g., patients with different ages). Second, these
black-box models lack interpretability. When making diagnostic predictions, it
is important to understand why a model makes a decision for trustworthy and
safety considerations. In this paper, to address these two limitations, we
propose a new paradigm to build robust and interpretable medical image
classifiers with natural language concepts. Specifically, we first query
clinical concepts from GPT-4, then transform latent image features into
explicit concepts with a vision-language model. We systematically evaluate our
method on eight medical image classification datasets to verify its
effectiveness. On challenging datasets with strong confounding factors, our
method can mitigate spurious correlations thus substantially outperform
standard visual encoders and other baselines. Finally, we show how
classification with a small number of concepts brings a level of
interpretability for understanding model decisions through case studies in real
medical data.

    <title>Explainable AI and Machine Learning Towards Human Gait Deterioration
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Gait analysis, an expanding research area, employs non invasive sensors and
machine learning techniques for a range of applicatio ns. In this study, we
concentrate on gait analysis for detecting cognitive decline in Parkinson's
disease (PD) and under dual task conditions. Using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and explainable machine learning, we objectively analyze gait
data and associate findings with clinically relevant biomarkers. This is
accomplished by connecting machine learning outputs to decisions based on human
visual observations or derived quantitative gait parameters, which are tested
and routinely implemented in curr ent healthcare practice. Our analysis of gait
deterioration due to cognitive decline in PD enables robust results using the
proposed methods for assessing PD severity from ground reaction force (GRF)
data. We achieved classification accuracies of 98% F1 sc ores for each
PhysioNet.org dataset and 95.5% F1 scores for the combined PhysioNet dataset.
By linking clinically observable features to the model outputs, we demonstrate
the impact of PD severity on gait. Furthermore, we explore the significance of
cognit ive load in healthy gait analysis, resulting in robust classification
accuracies of 100% F1 scores for subject identity verification. We also
identify weaker features crucial for model predictions using Layer Wise
Relevance Propagation. A notable finding o f this study reveals that cognitive
deterioration's effect on gait influences body balance and foot landing/lifting
dynamics in both classification cases: cognitive load in healthy gait and
cognitive decline in PD gait.

    <title>SoftTiger: A Clinical Foundation Model for Healthcare Workflows</title>
    <summary>  We introduce SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) designed as a
foundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured
nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization.
We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data,
according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate
data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical
impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a
state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training
is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical
tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and
then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we
address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long
context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms
other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a
mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards
healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release
SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as
datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a
significant contribution to the healthcare industry.

    <title>Conceptualizing Machine Learning for Dynamic Information Retrieval of
  Electronic Health Record Notes</title>
    <summary>  The large amount of time clinicians spend sifting through patient notes and
documenting in electronic health records (EHRs) is a leading cause of clinician
burnout. By proactively and dynamically retrieving relevant notes during the
documentation process, we can reduce the effort required to find relevant
patient history. In this work, we conceptualize the use of EHR audit logs for
machine learning as a source of supervision of note relevance in a specific
clinical context, at a particular point in time. Our evaluation focuses on the
dynamic retrieval in the emergency department, a high acuity setting with
unique patterns of information retrieval and note writing. We show that our
methods can achieve an AUC of 0.963 for predicting which notes will be read in
an individual note writing session. We additionally conduct a user study with
several clinicians and find that our framework can help clinicians retrieve
relevant information more efficiently. Demonstrating that our framework and
methods can perform well in this demanding setting is a promising proof of
concept that they will translate to other clinical settings and data modalities
(e.g., labs, medications, imaging).

    <title>A Bayesian Deep Learning Framework for End-To-End Prediction of Emotion
  from Heartbeat</title>
    <summary>  Automatic prediction of emotion promises to revolutionise human-computer
interaction. Recent trends involve fusion of multiple data modalities - audio,
visual, and physiological - to classify emotional state. However, in practice,
collection of physiological data `in the wild' is currently limited to
heartbeat time series of the kind generated by affordable wearable heart
monitors. Furthermore, real-world applications of emotion prediction often
require some measure of uncertainty over model output, in order to inform
downstream decision-making. We present here an end-to-end deep learning model
for classifying emotional valence from unimodal heartbeat time series. We
further propose a Bayesian framework for modelling uncertainty over these
valence predictions, and describe a probabilistic procedure for choosing to
accept or reject model output according to the intended application. We
benchmarked our framework against two established datasets and achieved peak
classification accuracy of 90%. These results lay the foundation for
applications of affective computing in real-world domains such as healthcare,
where a high premium is placed on non-invasive collection of data, and
predictive certainty.

    <title>Medically Aware GPT-3 as a Data Generator for Medical Dialogue
  Summarization</title>
    <summary>  In medical dialogue summarization, summaries must be coherent and must
capture all the medically relevant information in the dialogue. However,
learning effective models for summarization require large amounts of labeled
data which is especially hard to obtain. We present an algorithm to create
synthetic training data with an explicit focus on capturing medically relevant
information. We utilize GPT-3 as the backbone of our algorithm and scale 210
human labeled examples to yield results comparable to using 6400 human labeled
examples (~30x) leveraging low-shot learning and an ensemble method. In
detailed experiments, we show that this approach produces high quality training
data that can further be combined with human labeled data to get summaries that
are strongly preferable to those produced by models trained on human data alone
both in terms of medical accuracy and coherency.

    <title>The Medkit-Learn(ing) Environment: Medical Decision Modelling through
  Simulation</title>
    <summary>  Understanding decision-making in clinical environments is of paramount
importance if we are to bring the strengths of machine learning to ultimately
improve patient outcomes. Several factors including the availability of public
data, the intrinsically offline nature of the problem, and the complexity of
human decision making, has meant that the mainstream development of algorithms
is often geared towards optimal performance in tasks that do not necessarily
translate well into the medical regime; often overlooking more niche issues
commonly associated with the area. We therefore present a new benchmarking
suite designed specifically for medical sequential decision making: the
Medkit-Learn(ing) Environment, a publicly available Python package providing
simple and easy access to high-fidelity synthetic medical data. While providing
a standardised way to compare algorithms in a realistic medical setting we
employ a generating process that disentangles the policy and environment
dynamics to allow for a range of customisations, thus enabling systematic
evaluation of algorithms' robustness against specific challenges prevalent in
healthcare.

    <title>Assessing the Impact of Blood Pressure on Cardiac Function Using
  Interpretable Biomarkers and Variational Autoencoders</title>
    <summary>  Maintaining good cardiac function for as long as possible is a major concern
for healthcare systems worldwide and there is much interest in learning more
about the impact of different risk factors on cardiac health. The aim of this
study is to analyze the impact of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on cardiac
function while preserving the interpretability of the model using known
clinical biomarkers in a large cohort of the UK Biobank population. We propose
a novel framework that combines deep learning based estimation of interpretable
clinical biomarkers from cardiac cine MR data with a variational autoencoder
(VAE). The VAE architecture integrates a regression loss in the latent space,
which enables the progression of cardiac health with SBP to be learnt. Results
on 3,600 subjects from the UK Biobank show that the proposed model allows us to
gain important insight into the deterioration of cardiac function with
increasing SBP, identify key interpretable factors involved in this process,
and lastly exploit the model to understand patterns of positive and adverse
adaptation of cardiac function.

    <title>Automatic Feature Extraction for Heartbeat Anomaly Detection</title>
    <summary>  We focus on automatic feature extraction for raw audio heartbeat sounds,
aimed at anomaly detection applications in healthcare. We learn features with
the help of an autoencoder composed by a 1D non-causal convolutional encoder
and a WaveNet decoder trained with a modified objective based on variational
inference, employing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Moreover we model the
latent distribution using a Gaussian chain graphical model to capture temporal
correlations which characterize the encoded signals. After training the
autoencoder on the reconstruction task in a unsupervised manner, we test the
significance of the learned latent representations by training an SVM to
predict anomalies. We evaluate the methods on a problem proposed by the PASCAL
Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge and we compare with results in the
literature.

    <title>Confounding-Robust Policy Evaluation in Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Off-policy evaluation of sequential decision policies from observational data
is necessary in applications of batch reinforcement learning such as education
and healthcare. In such settings, however, unobserved variables confound
observed actions, rendering exact evaluation of new policies impossible, i.e.,
unidentifiable. We develop a robust approach that estimates sharp bounds on the
(unidentifiable) value of a given policy in an infinite-horizon problem given
data from another policy with unobserved confounding, subject to a sensitivity
model. We consider stationary or baseline unobserved confounding and compute
bounds by optimizing over the set of all stationary state-occupancy ratios that
agree with a new partially identified estimating equation and the sensitivity
model. We prove convergence to the sharp bounds as we collect more confounded
data. Although checking set membership is a linear program, the support
function is given by a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. We develop
approximations based on nonconvex projected gradient descent and demonstrate
the resulting bounds empirically.

    <summary>  In this work we introduce Disease Progression Modeling workbench 360 (DPM360)
opensource clinical informatics framework for collaborative research and
delivery of healthcare AI. DPM360, when fully developed, will manage the entire
modeling life cycle, from data analysis (e.g., cohort identification) to
machine learning algorithm development and prototyping. DPM360 augments the
advantages of data model standardization and tooling (OMOP-CDM, Athena, ATLAS)
provided by the widely-adopted OHDSI initiative with a powerful machine

    <title>ADCB: An Alzheimer's disease benchmark for evaluating observational
  estimators of causal effects</title>
    <summary>  Simulators make unique benchmarks for causal effect estimation since they do
not rely on unverifiable assumptions or the ability to intervene on real-world
systems, but are often too simple to capture important aspects of real
applications. We propose a simulator of Alzheimer's disease aimed at modeling
intricacies of healthcare data while enabling benchmarking of causal effect and
policy estimators. We fit the system to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset and ground hand-crafted components in results from
comparative treatment trials and observational treatment patterns. The
simulator includes parameters which alter the nature and difficulty of the
causal inference tasks, such as latent variables, effect heterogeneity, length
of observed history, behavior policy and sample size. We use the simulator to
compare estimators of average and conditional treatment effects.

    <title>A Multimodal Dataset of 21,412 Recorded Nights for Sleep and Respiratory
  Research</title>
    <summary>  This study introduces a novel, rich dataset obtained from home sleep apnea
tests using the FDA-approved WatchPAT-300 device, collected from 7,077
participants over 21,412 nights. The dataset comprises three levels of sleep
data: raw multi-channel time-series from sensors, annotated sleep events, and
computed summary statistics, which include 447 features related to sleep
architecture, sleep apnea, and heart rate variability (HRV). We present
reference values for Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), sleep efficiency, Wake After
Sleep Onset (WASO), and HRV sample entropy, stratified by age and sex.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the dataset improves the predictive capability
for various health related traits, including body composition, bone density,
blood sugar levels and cardiovascular health. These results illustrate the
dataset's potential to advance sleep research, personalized healthcare, and
machine learning applications in biomedicine.

    <title>Fair Patient Model: Mitigating Bias in the Patient Representation
  Learned from the Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To pre-train fair and unbiased patient representations from
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using a novel weighted loss function that
reduces bias and improves fairness in deep representation learning models.
  Methods: We defined a new loss function, called weighted loss function, in
the deep representation learning model to balance the importance of different
groups of patients and features. We applied the proposed model, called Fair
Patient Model (FPM), to a sample of 34,739 patients from the MIMIC-III dataset
and learned patient representations for four clinical outcome prediction tasks.
  Results: FPM outperformed the baseline models in terms of three fairness
metrics: demographic parity, equality of opportunity difference, and equalized
odds ratio. FPM also achieved comparable predictive performance with the
baselines, with an average accuracy of 0.7912. Feature analysis revealed that
FPM captured more information from clinical features than the baselines.
  Conclusion: FPM is a novel method to pre-train fair and unbiased patient
representations from EHR data using a weighted loss function. The learned
representations can be used for various downstream tasks in healthcare and can
be extended to other domains where bias and fairness are important.

    <title>ETP: Learning Transferable ECG Representations via ECG-Text Pre-training</title>
    <summary>  In the domain of cardiovascular healthcare, the Electrocardiogram (ECG)
serves as a critical, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Although recent strides in
self-supervised learning (SSL) have been promising for ECG representation
learning, these techniques often require annotated samples and struggle with
classes not present in the fine-tuning stages. To address these limitations, we
introduce ECG-Text Pre-training (ETP), an innovative framework designed to
learn cross-modal representations that link ECG signals with textual reports.
For the first time, this framework leverages the zero-shot classification task
in the ECG domain. ETP employs an ECG encoder along with a pre-trained language
model to align ECG signals with their corresponding textual reports. The
proposed framework excels in both linear evaluation and zero-shot
classification tasks, as demonstrated on the PTB-XL and CPSC2018 datasets,
showcasing its ability for robust and generalizable cross-modal ECG feature
learning.

    <title>Semi-Supervised Graph Representation Learning with Human-centric
  Explanation for Predicting Fatty Liver Disease</title>
    <summary>  Addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in clinical settings,
particularly in the prediction of fatty liver disease, this study explores the
potential of graph representation learning within a semi-supervised learning
framework. Leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), our approach constructs a
subject similarity graph to identify risk patterns from health checkup data.
The effectiveness of various GNN approaches in this context is demonstrated,
even with minimal labeled samples. Central to our methodology is the inclusion
of human-centric explanations through explainable GNNs, providing personalized
feature importance scores for enhanced interpretability and clinical relevance,
thereby underscoring the potential of our approach in advancing healthcare
practices with a keen focus on graph representation learning and human-centric
explanation.

    <title>A Conservative Q-Learning approach for handling distribution shift in
  sepsis treatment strategies</title>
    <summary>  Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and its treatment is very expensive.
Sepsis treatment is also very challenging because there is no consensus on what
interventions work best and different patients respond very differently to the
same treatment. Deep Reinforcement Learning methods can be used to come up with
optimal policies for treatment strategies mirroring physician actions. In the
healthcare scenario, the available data is mostly collected offline with no
interaction with the environment, which necessitates the use of offline RL
techniques. The Offline RL paradigm suffers from action distribution shifts
which in turn negatively affects learning an optimal policy for the treatment.
In this work, a Conservative-Q Learning (CQL) algorithm is used to mitigate
this shift and its corresponding policy reaches closer to the physicians policy
than conventional deep Q Learning. The policy learned could help clinicians in
Intensive Care Units to make better decisions while treating septic patients
and improve survival rate.

    <title>Learning to Abstain From Uninformative Data</title>
    <summary>  Learning and decision-making in domains with naturally high noise-to-signal
ratio, such as Finance or Healthcare, is often challenging, while the stakes
are very high. In this paper, we study the problem of learning and acting under
a general noisy generative process. In this problem, the data distribution has
a significant proportion of uninformative samples with high noise in the label,
while part of the data contains useful information represented by low label
noise. This dichotomy is present during both training and inference, which
requires the proper handling of uninformative data during both training and
testing. We propose a novel approach to learning under these conditions via a
loss inspired by the selective learning theory. By minimizing this loss, the
model is guaranteed to make a near-optimal decision by distinguishing
informative data from uninformative data and making predictions. We build upon
the strength of our theoretical guarantees by describing an iterative
algorithm, which jointly optimizes both a predictor and a selector, and
evaluates its empirical performance in a variety of settings.

    <title>A review of uncertainty quantification in medical image analysis:
  probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods</title>
    <summary>  The comprehensive integration of machine learning healthcare models within
clinical practice remains suboptimal, notwithstanding the proliferation of
high-performing solutions reported in the literature. A predominant factor
hindering widespread adoption pertains to an insufficiency of evidence
affirming the reliability of the aforementioned models. Recently, uncertainty
quantification methods have been proposed as a potential solution to quantify
the reliability of machine learning models and thus increase the
interpretability and acceptability of the result. In this review, we offer a
comprehensive overview of prevailing methods proposed to quantify uncertainty
inherent in machine learning models developed for various medical image tasks.
Contrary to earlier reviews that exclusively focused on probabilistic methods,
this review also explores non-probabilistic approaches, thereby furnishing a
more holistic survey of research pertaining to uncertainty quantification for
machine learning models. Analysis of medical images with the summary and
discussion on medical applications and the corresponding uncertainty evaluation
protocols are presented, which focus on the specific challenges of uncertainty
in medical image analysis. We also highlight some potential future research
work at the end. Generally, this review aims to allow researchers from both
clinical and technical backgrounds to gain a quick and yet in-depth
understanding of the research in uncertainty quantification for medical image
analysis machine learning models.

    <title>CovidAID: COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray</title>
    <summary>  The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare
systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every
patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques
(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.
Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high
risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already
available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems
already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples
either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the
selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an
inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to
keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in
COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood
of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,
we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients
using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where
radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology
scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural
network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly
available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100%
sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon
the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.

    <title>Towards Scheduling Federated Deep Learning using Meta-Gradients for
  Inter-Hospital Learning</title>
    <summary>  Given the abundance and ease of access of personal data today, individual
privacy has become of paramount importance, particularly in the healthcare
domain. In this work, we aim to utilise patient data extracted from multiple
hospital data centres to train a machine learning model without sacrificing
patient privacy. We develop a scheduling algorithm in conjunction with a
student-teacher algorithm that is deployed in a federated manner. This allows a
central model to learn from batches of data at each federal node. The teacher
acts between data centres to update the main task (student) algorithm using the
data that is stored in the various data centres. We show that the scheduler,
trained using meta-gradients, can effectively organise training and as a result
train a machine learning model on a diverse dataset without needing explicit
access to the patient data. We achieve state-of-the-art performance and show
how our method overcomes some of the problems faced in the federated learning
such as node poisoning. We further show how the scheduler can be used as a
mechanism for transfer learning, allowing different teachers to work together
in training a student for state-of-the-art performance.

    <title>Deep Learning on Mobile Devices - A Review</title>
    <summary>  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning and artificial intelligence
technologies have enabled numerous mobile applications. While traditional
computation paradigms rely on mobile sensing and cloud computing, deep learning
implemented on mobile devices provides several advantages. These advantages
include low communication bandwidth, small cloud computing resource cost, quick
response time, and improved data privacy. Research and development of deep
learning on mobile and embedded devices has recently attracted much attention.
This paper provides a timely review of this fast-paced field to give the
researcher, engineer, practitioner, and graduate student a quick grasp on the
recent advancements of deep learning on mobile devices. In this paper, we
discuss hardware architectures for mobile deep learning, including Field
Programmable Gate Arrays, Application Specific Integrated Circuit, and recent
mobile Graphic Processing Units. We present Size, Weight, Area and Power
considerations and their relation to algorithm optimizations, such as
quantization, pruning, compression, and approximations that simplify
computation while retaining performance accuracy. We cover existing systems and
give a state-of-the-industry review of TensorFlow, MXNet, Mobile AI Compute
Engine, and Paddle-mobile deep learning platform. We discuss resources for
mobile deep learning practitioners, including tools, libraries, models, and
performance benchmarks. We present applications of various mobile sensing
modalities to industries, ranging from robotics, healthcare and multi-media,
biometrics to autonomous drive and defense. We address the key deep learning
challenges to overcome, including low quality data, and small
training/adaptation data sets. In addition, the review provides numerous
citations and links to existing code bases implementing various technologies.

    <title>Accounting for Unobserved Confounding in Domain Generalization</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the problem of learning robust, generalizable
prediction models from a combination of multiple datasets and qualitative
assumptions about the underlying data-generating model. Part of the challenge
of learning robust models lies in the influence of unobserved confounders that
void many of the invariances and principles of minimum error presently used for
this problem. Our approach is to define a different invariance property of
causal solutions in the presence of unobserved confounders which, through a
relaxation of this invariance, can be connected with an explicit
distributionally robust optimization problem over a set of affine combination
of data distributions. Concretely, our objective takes the form of a standard
loss, plus a regularization term that encourages partial equality of error
derivatives with respect to model parameters. We demonstrate the empirical
performance of our approach on healthcare data from different modalities,
including image, speech and tabular data.

    <title>Unifying PAC and Regret: Uniform PAC Bounds for Episodic Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Statistical performance bounds for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can
be critical for high-stakes applications like healthcare. This paper introduces
a new framework for theoretically measuring the performance of such algorithms
called Uniform-PAC, which is a strengthening of the classical Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In contrast to the PAC framework, the
uniform version may be used to derive high probability regret guarantees and so
forms a bridge between the two setups that has been missing in the literature.
We demonstrate the benefits of the new framework for finite-state episodic MDPs
with a new algorithm that is Uniform-PAC and simultaneously achieves optimal
regret and PAC guarantees except for a factor of the horizon.

    <title>Synergetic Learning of Heterogeneous Temporal Sequences for
  Multi-Horizon Probabilistic Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Time-series is ubiquitous across applications, such as transportation,
finance and healthcare. Time-series is often influenced by external factors,
especially in the form of asynchronous events, making forecasting difficult.
However, existing models are mainly designated for either synchronous
time-series or asynchronous event sequence, and can hardly provide a synthetic
way to capture the relation between them. We propose Variational Synergetic
Multi-Horizon Network (VSMHN), a novel deep conditional generative model. To
learn complex correlations across heterogeneous sequences, a tailored encoder
is devised to combine the advances in deep point processes models and
variational recurrent neural networks. In addition, an aligned time coding and
an auxiliary transition scheme are carefully devised for batched training on
unaligned sequences. Our model can be trained effectively using stochastic
variational inference and generates probabilistic predictions with Monte-Carlo
simulation. Furthermore, our model produces accurate, sharp and more realistic
probabilistic forecasts. We also show that modeling asynchronous event
sequences is crucial for multi-horizon time-series forecasting.

    <title>Using NASA Satellite Data Sources and Geometric Deep Learning to Uncover
  Hidden Patterns in COVID-19 Clinical Severity</title>
    <summary>  As multiple adverse events in 2021 illustrated, virtually all aspects of our
societal functioning -- from water and food security to energy supply to
healthcare -- more than ever depend on the dynamics of environmental factors.
Nevertheless, the social dimensions of weather and climate are noticeably less
explored by the machine learning community, largely, due to the lack of
reliable and easy access to use data. Here we present a unique not yet broadly
available NASA's satellite dataset on aerosol optical depth (AOD), temperature
and relative humidity and discuss the utility of these new data for COVID-19
biosurveillance. In particular, using the geometric deep learning models for
semi-supervised classification on a county-level basis over the contiguous
United States, we investigate the pressing societal question whether
atmospheric variables have considerable impact on COVID-19 clinical severity.

    <title>Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Classification Via a Contrastive
  Diffusion Autoencoder</title>
    <summary>  In visual object classification, humans often justify their choices by
comparing objects to prototypical examples within that class. We may therefore
increase the interpretability of deep learning models by imbuing them with a
similar style of reasoning. In this work, we apply this principle by
classifying Alzheimer's Disease based on the similarity of images to training
examples within the latent space. We use a contrastive loss combined with a
diffusion autoencoder backbone, to produce a semantically meaningful latent
space, such that neighbouring latents have similar image-level features. We
achieve a classification accuracy comparable to black box approaches on a
dataset of 2D MRI images, whilst producing human interpretable model
explanations. Therefore, this work stands as a contribution to the pertinent
development of accurate and interpretable deep learning within medical imaging.

    <title>GATGPT: A Pre-trained Large Language Model with Graph Attention Network
  for Spatiotemporal Imputation</title>
    <summary>  The analysis of spatiotemporal data is increasingly utilized across diverse
domains, including transportation, healthcare, and meteorology. In real-world
settings, such data often contain missing elements due to issues like sensor
malfunctions and data transmission errors. The objective of spatiotemporal
imputation is to estimate these missing values by understanding the inherent
spatial and temporal relationships in the observed multivariate time series.
Traditionally, spatiotemporal imputation has relied on specific, intricate
architectures designed for this purpose, which suffer from limited
applicability and high computational complexity. In contrast, our approach
integrates pre-trained large language models (LLMs) into spatiotemporal
imputation, introducing a groundbreaking framework, GATGPT. This framework
merges a graph attention mechanism with LLMs. We maintain most of the LLM
parameters unchanged to leverage existing knowledge for learning temporal
patterns, while fine-tuning the upper layers tailored to various applications.
The graph attention component enhances the LLM's ability to understand spatial
relationships. Through tests on three distinct real-world datasets, our
innovative approach demonstrates comparable results to established deep
learning benchmarks.

    <title>Personalized Reinforcement Learning with a Budget of Policies</title>
    <summary>  Personalization in machine learning (ML) tailors models' decisions to the
individual characteristics of users. While this approach has seen success in
areas like recommender systems, its expansion into high-stakes fields such as
healthcare and autonomous driving is hindered by the extensive regulatory
approval processes involved. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
framework termed represented Markov Decision Processes (r-MDPs) that is
designed to balance the need for personalization with the regulatory
constraints. In an r-MDP, we cater to a diverse user population, each with
unique preferences, through interaction with a small set of representative
policies. Our objective is twofold: efficiently match each user to an
appropriate representative policy and simultaneously optimize these policies to
maximize overall social welfare. We develop two deep reinforcement learning
algorithms that efficiently solve r-MDPs. These algorithms draw inspiration
from the principles of classic K-means clustering and are underpinned by robust
theoretical foundations. Our empirical investigations, conducted across a
variety of simulated environments, showcase the algorithms' ability to
facilitate meaningful personalization even under constrained policy budgets.
Furthermore, they demonstrate scalability, efficiently adapting to larger
policy budgets.

    <title>Semi-automated Annotation of Signal Events in Clinical EEG Data</title>
    <summary>  To be effective, state of the art machine learning technology needs large
amounts of annotated data. There are numerous compelling applications in
healthcare that can benefit from high performance automated decision support
systems provided by deep learning technology, but they lack the comprehensive
data resources required to apply sophisticated machine learning models.
Further, for economic reasons, it is very difficult to justify the creation of
large annotated corpora for these applications. Hence, automated annotation
techniques become increasingly important. In this study, we investigated the
effectiveness of using an active learning algorithm to automatically annotate a
large EEG corpus. The algorithm is designed to annotate six types of EEG
events. Two model training schemes, namely threshold-based and volume-based,
are evaluated. In the threshold-based scheme the threshold of confidence scores
is optimized in the initial training iteration, whereas for the volume-based
scheme only a certain amount of data is preserved after each iteration.
Recognition performance is improved 2% absolute and the system is capable of
automatically annotating previously unlabeled data. Given that the
interpretation of clinical EEG data is an exceedingly difficult task, this
study provides some evidence that the proposed method is a viable alternative
to expensive manual annotation.

    <title>Predicting Heart Failure Readmission from Clinical Notes Using Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Heart failure hospitalization is a severe burden on healthcare. How to
predict and therefore prevent readmission has been a significant challenge in
outcomes research. To address this, we propose a deep learning approach to
predict readmission from clinical notes. Unlike conventional methods that use
structured data for prediction, we leverage the unstructured clinical notes to
train deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We
then use the trained models to classify and predict potentially high-risk
admissions/patients. For evaluation, we trained CNNs using the discharge
summary notes in the MIMIC III database. We also trained regular machine
learning models based on random forest using the same datasets. The result
shows that deep learning models outperform the regular models in prediction
tasks. CNN method achieves a F1 score of 0.756 in general readmission
prediction and 0.733 in 30-day readmission prediction, while random forest only
achieves a F1 score of 0.674 and 0.656 respectively. We also propose a
chi-square test based method to interpret key features associated with deep
learning predicted readmissions. It reveals clinical insights about readmission
embedded in the clinical notes. Collectively, our method can make the human
evaluation process more efficient and potentially facilitate the reduction of
readmission rates.

    <title>An Information-theoretical Approach to Semi-supervised Learning under
  Covariate-shift</title>
    <summary>  A common assumption in semi-supervised learning is that the labeled,
unlabeled, and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, this
assumption is not satisfied in many applications. In many scenarios, the data
is collected sequentially (e.g., healthcare) and the distribution of the data
may change over time often exhibiting so-called covariate shifts. In this
paper, we propose an approach for semi-supervised learning algorithms that is
capable of addressing this issue. Our framework also recovers some popular
methods, including entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling. We provide new
information-theoretical based generalization error upper bounds inspired by our
novel framework. Our bounds are applicable to both general semi-supervised
learning and the covariate-shift scenario. Finally, we show numerically that
our method outperforms previous approaches proposed for semi-supervised
learning under the covariate shift.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning and Bandits for Speech and Language Processing:
  Tutorial, Review and Outlook</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, reinforcement learning and bandits have transformed a wide
range of real-world applications including healthcare, finance, recommendation
systems, robotics, and last but not least, the speech and natural language
processing. While most speech and language applications of reinforcement
learning algorithms are centered around improving the training of deep neural
networks with its flexible optimization properties, there are still many
grounds to explore to utilize the benefits of reinforcement learning, such as
its reward-driven adaptability, state representations, temporal structures and
generalizability. In this survey, we present an overview of recent advancements
of reinforcement learning and bandits, and discuss how they can be effectively
employed to solve speech and natural language processing problems with models
that are adaptive, interactive and scalable.

    <title>DNA Methylation Data to Predict Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Deaths: A
  Machine Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this study is to predict suicidal and non-suicidal deaths
from DNA methylation data using a modern machine learning algorithm. We used
support vector machines to classify existing secondary data consisting of
normalized values of methylated DNA probe intensities from tissues of two
cortical brain regions to distinguish suicide cases from control cases. Before
classification, we employed Principal component analysis (PCA) and
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of
the data. In comparison to PCA, the modern data visualization method t-SNE
performs better in dimensionality reduction. t-SNE accounts for the possible
non-linear patterns in low-dimensional data. We applied four-fold
cross-validation in which the resulting output from t-SNE was used as training
data for the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Despite the use of cross-validation,
the nominally perfect prediction of suicidal deaths for BA11 data suggests
possible over-fitting of the model. The study also may have suffered from
'spectrum bias' since the individuals were only studied from two extreme
scenarios. This research constitutes a baseline study for classifying suicidal
and non-suicidal deaths from DNA methylation data. Future studies with larger
sample size, while possibly incorporating methylation data from living
individuals, may reduce the bias and improve the accuracy of the results.

    <title>Machine Learning Sensors for Diagnosis of COVID-19 Disease Using Routine
  Blood Values for Internet of Things Application</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare digitalization requires effective applications of human sensors,
when various parameters of the human body are instantly monitored in everyday
life due to the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, machine learning (ML)
sensors for the prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 are an important option for IoT
application in healthcare and ambient assisted living (AAL). Determining a
COVID-19 infected status with various diagnostic tests and imaging results is
costly and time-consuming. This study provides a fast, reliable and
cost-effective alternative tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the
routine blood values (RBVs) measured at admission. The dataset of the study
consists of a total of 5296 patients with the same number of negative and
positive COVID-19 test results and 51 routine blood values. In this study, 13
popular classifier machine learning models and the LogNNet neural network model
were exanimated. The most successful classifier model in terms of time and
accuracy in the detection of the disease was the histogram-based gradient
boosting (HGB) (accuracy: 100%, time: 6.39 sec). The HGB classifier identified
the 11 most important features (LDL, cholesterol, HDL-C, MCHC, triglyceride,
amylase, UA, LDH, CK-MB, ALP and MCH) to detect the disease with 100% accuracy.
In addition, the importance of single, double and triple combinations of these
features in the diagnosis of the disease was discussed. We propose to use these
11 features and their binary combinations as important biomarkers for ML
sensors in the diagnosis of the disease, supporting edge computing on Arduino
and cloud IoT service.

    <title>Identifying Risk Factors for Post-COVID-19 Mental Health Disorders: A
  Machine Learning Perspective</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we leveraged machine learning techniques to identify risk
factors associated with post-COVID-19 mental health disorders. Our analysis,
based on data collected from 669 patients across various provinces in Iraq,
yielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region
of residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of
developing mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,
comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical
predictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies,
and perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings
emphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of
mental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery. Healthcare providers and
policymakers should consider these risk factors when designing targeted
interventions and support systems for individuals at risk. Machine
learning-based approaches can provide a valuable tool for predicting and
preventing adverse mental health outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients. Further
research and prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and
enhance our understanding of the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding the
mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and underscores the
importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address the diverse needs of
individuals on the path to recovery. Keywords: COVID-19, mental health, risk

    <title>Resource-Constrained Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Labels and
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Various IoT applications demand resource-constrained machine learning
mechanisms for different applications such as pervasive healthcare, activity
monitoring, speech recognition, real-time computer vision, etc. This
necessitates us to leverage information from multiple devices with few
communication overheads. Federated Learning proves to be an extremely viable
option for distributed and collaborative machine learning. Particularly,
on-device federated learning is an active area of research, however, there are
a variety of challenges in addressing statistical (non-IID data) and model
heterogeneities. In addition, in this paper we explore a new challenge of
interest -- to handle label heterogeneities in federated learning. To this end,
we propose a framework with simple $\alpha$-weighted federated aggregation of
scores which leverages overlapping information gain across labels, while saving
bandwidth costs in the process. Empirical evaluation on Animals-10 dataset
(with 4 labels for effective elucidation of results) indicates an average
deterministic accuracy increase of at least ~16.7%. We also demonstrate the
on-device capabilities of our proposed framework by experimenting with
federated learning and inference across different iterations on a Raspberry Pi
2, a single-board computing platform.

    <title>Online Algorithm for Unsupervised Sensor Selection</title>
    <summary>  In many security and healthcare systems, the detection and diagnosis systems
use a sequence of sensors/tests. Each test outputs a prediction of the latent
state and carries an inherent cost. However, the correctness of the predictions
cannot be evaluated since the ground truth annotations may not be available.
Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting a test that gives the best
trade-off between accuracy and costs in such Unsupervised Sensor Selection
(USS) problems. Clearly, learning is feasible only if ground truth can be
inferred (explicitly or implicitly) from the problem structure. It is observed
that this happens if the problem satisfies the 'Weak Dominance' (WD) property.
We set up the USS problem as a stochastic partial monitoring problem and
develop an algorithm with sub-linear regret under the WD property. We argue
that our algorithm is optimal and evaluate its performance on problem instances
generated from synthetic and real-world datasets.

    <title>POPCORN: Partially Observed Prediction COnstrained ReiNforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Many medical decision-making tasks can be framed as partially observed Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). However, prevailing two-stage approaches that
first learn a POMDP and then solve it often fail because the model that best
fits the data may not be well suited for planning. We introduce a new
optimization objective that (a) produces both high-performing policies and
high-quality generative models, even when some observations are irrelevant for
planning, and (b) does so in batch off-policy settings that are typical in
healthcare, when only retrospective data is available. We demonstrate our
approach on synthetic examples and a challenging medical decision-making
problem.

    <title>The Future of Digital Health with Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Data-driven Machine Learning has emerged as a promising approach for building
accurate and robust statistical models from medical data, which is collected in
huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Existing medical data is not fully
exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns
restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML
will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making
the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key
factors contributing to this issue, explores how Federated Learning (FL) may
provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the
challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.

    <title>A review on different techniques used to combat the non-IID and
  heterogeneous nature of data in FL</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) is a machine-learning approach enabling collaborative
model training across multiple decentralized edge devices that hold local data
samples, all without exchanging these samples. This collaborative process
occurs under the supervision of a central server orchestrating the training or
via a peer-to-peer network. The significance of FL is particularly pronounced
in industries such as healthcare and finance, where data privacy holds
paramount importance. However, training a model under the Federated learning
setting brings forth several challenges, with one of the most prominent being
the heterogeneity of data distribution among the edge devices. The data is
typically non-independently and non-identically distributed (non-IID), thereby
presenting challenges to model convergence. This report delves into the issues
arising from non-IID and heterogeneous data and explores current algorithms
designed to address these challenges.

    <title>Perfect Match: A Simple Method for Learning Representations For
  Counterfactual Inference With Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Learning representations for counterfactual inference from observational data
is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as healthcare, public
policy and economics. Counterfactual inference enables one to answer "What
if...?" questions, such as "What would be the outcome if we gave this patient
treatment $t_1$?". However, current methods for training neural networks for
counterfactual inference on observational data are either overly complex,
limited to settings with only two available treatments, or both. Here, we
present Perfect Match (PM), a method for training neural networks for
counterfactual inference that is easy to implement, compatible with any
architecture, does not add computational complexity or hyperparameters, and
extends to any number of treatments. PM is based on the idea of augmenting
samples within a minibatch with their propensity-matched nearest neighbours.
Our experiments demonstrate that PM outperforms a number of more complex
state-of-the-art methods in inferring counterfactual outcomes across several
benchmarks, particularly in settings with many treatments.

    <title>SoQal: Selective Oracle Questioning in Active Learning</title>
    <summary>  Large sets of unlabelled data within the healthcare domain remain
underutilized. Active learning offers a way to exploit these datasets by
iteratively requesting an oracle (e.g. medical professional) to label
instances. This process, which can be costly and time-consuming is
overly-dependent upon an oracle. To alleviate this burden, we propose SoQal, a
questioning strategy that dynamically determines when a label should be
requested from an oracle. We perform experiments on five publically-available
datasets and illustrate SoQal's superiority relative to baseline approaches,
including its ability to reduce oracle label requests by up to 35%. SoQal also
performs competitively in the presence of label noise: a scenario that
simulates clinicians' uncertain diagnoses when faced with difficult
classification tasks.

    <title>Calibrating Healthcare AI: Towards Reliable and Interpretable Deep
  Predictive Models</title>
    <summary>  The wide-spread adoption of representation learning technologies in clinical
decision making strongly emphasizes the need for characterizing model
reliability and enabling rigorous introspection of model behavior. While the
former need is often addressed by incorporating uncertainty quantification
strategies, the latter challenge is addressed using a broad class of
interpretability techniques. In this paper, we argue that these two objectives
are not necessarily disparate and propose to utilize prediction calibration to
meet both objectives. More specifically, our approach is comprised of a
calibration-driven learning method, which is also used to design an
interpretability technique based on counterfactual reasoning. Furthermore, we
introduce \textit{reliability plots}, a holistic evaluation mechanism for model
reliability. Using a lesion classification problem with dermoscopy images, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and infer interesting insights
about the model behavior.

    <title>Learning Hierarchical Representations of Electronic Health Records for
  Clinical Outcome Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Clinical outcome prediction based on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) plays
a crucial role in improving the quality of healthcare. Conventional deep
sequential models fail to capture the rich temporal patterns encoded in the
longand irregular clinical event sequences. We make the observation that
clinical events at a long time scale exhibit strongtemporal patterns, while
events within a short time period tend to be disordered co-occurrence. We thus
propose differentiated mechanisms to model clinical events at different time
scales. Our model learns hierarchical representationsof event sequences, to
adaptively distinguish between short-range and long-range events, and
accurately capture coretemporal dependencies. Experimental results on real
clinical data show that our model greatly improves over previous
state-of-the-art models, achieving AUC scores of 0.94 and 0.90 for predicting
death and ICU admission respectively, Our model also successfully identifies
important events for different clinical outcome prediction tasks

    <title>Incorporating Causal Effects into Deep Learning Predictions on EHR Data</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Health Records (EHR) data analysis plays a crucial role in
healthcare system quality. Because of its highly complex underlying causality
and limited observable nature, causal inference on EHR is quite challenging.
Deep Learning (DL) achieved great success among the advanced machine learning
methodologies. Nevertheless, it is still obstructed by the inappropriately
assumed causal conditions. This work proposed a novel method to quantify
clinically well-defined causal effects as a generalized estimation vector that
is simply utilizable for causal models. We incorporated it into DL models to
achieve better predictive performance and result interpretation. Furthermore,
we also proved the existence of causal information blink spots that regular DL
models cannot reach.

    <title>Tree-based local explanations of machine learning model predictions,
  AraucanaXAI</title>
    <summary>  Increasingly complex learning methods such as boosting, bagging and deep
learning have made ML models more accurate, but harder to understand and
interpret. A tradeoff between performance and intelligibility is often to be
faced, especially in high-stakes applications like medicine. In the present
article we propose a novel methodological approach for generating explanations
of the predictions of a generic ML model, given a specific instance for which
the prediction has been made, that can tackle both classification and
regression tasks. Advantages of the proposed XAI approach include improved
fidelity to the original model, the ability to deal with non-linear decision
boundaries, and native support to both classification and regression problems

    <title>A Flexible Framework for Incorporating Patient Preferences Into
  Q-Learning</title>
    <summary>  In real-world healthcare problems, there are often multiple competing
outcomes of interest, such as treatment efficacy and side effect severity.
However, statistical methods for estimating dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs)
usually assume a single outcome of interest, and the few methods that deal with
composite outcomes suffer from important limitations. This includes
restrictions to a single time point and two outcomes, the inability to
incorporate self-reported patient preferences and limited theoretical
guarantees. To this end, we propose a new method to address these limitations,
which we dub Latent Utility Q-Learning (LUQ-Learning). LUQ-Learning uses a
latent model approach to naturally extend Q-learning to the composite outcome
setting and adopt the ideal trade-off between outcomes to each patient. Unlike
previous approaches, our framework allows for an arbitrary number of time
points and outcomes, incorporates stated preferences and achieves strong
asymptotic performance with realistic assumptions on the data. We conduct
simulation experiments based on an ongoing trial for low back pain as well as a
well-known completed trial for schizophrenia. In all experiments, our method
achieves highly competitive empirical performance compared to several
alternative baselines.

    <title>A Survey on Generative Modeling with Limited Data, Few Shots, and Zero
  Shot</title>
    <summary>  In machine learning, generative modeling aims to learn to generate new data
statistically similar to the training data distribution. In this paper, we
survey learning generative models under limited data, few shots and zero shot,
referred to as Generative Modeling under Data Constraint (GM-DC). This is an
important topic when data acquisition is challenging, e.g. healthcare
applications. We discuss background, challenges, and propose two taxonomies:
one on GM-DC tasks and another on GM-DC approaches. Importantly, we study
interactions between different GM-DC tasks and approaches. Furthermore, we
highlight research gaps, research trends, and potential avenues for future
exploration. Project website: https://gmdc-survey.github.io.

    <title>Scalable Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Bayesian inference over the reward presents an ideal solution to the
ill-posed nature of the inverse reinforcement learning problem. Unfortunately
current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting
due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods
that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the
environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly
applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method,
Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both
of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over
the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an
appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational
approach to said latent reward. Applying our method to real medical data
alongside classic control simulations, we demonstrate Bayesian reward inference
in environments beyond the scope of current methods, as well as task
performance competitive with focused offline imitation learning algorithms.

    <title>Rank-N-Contrast: Learning Continuous Representations for Regression</title>
    <summary>  Deep regression models typically learn in an end-to-end fashion without
explicitly emphasizing a regression-aware representation. Consequently, the
learned representations exhibit fragmentation and fail to capture the
continuous nature of sample orders, inducing suboptimal results across a wide
range of regression tasks. To fill the gap, we propose Rank-N-Contrast (RNC), a
framework that learns continuous representations for regression by contrasting
samples against each other based on their rankings in the target space. We
demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that RNC guarantees the desired
order of learned representations in accordance with the target orders, enjoying
not only better performance but also significantly improved robustness,
efficiency, and generalization. Extensive experiments using five real-world
regression datasets that span computer vision, human-computer interaction, and
healthcare verify that RNC achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting
its intriguing properties including better data efficiency, robustness to
spurious targets and data corruptions, and generalization to distribution
shifts. Code is available at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/Rank-N-Contrast.

    <title>PiRL: Participant-Invariant Representation Learning for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Due to individual heterogeneity, performance gaps are observed between
generic (one-size-fits-all) models and person-specific models in data-driven
health applications. However, in real-world applications, generic models are
usually more favorable due to new-user-adaptation issues and system
complexities, etc. To improve the performance of the generic model, we propose
a representation learning framework that learns participant-invariant
representations, named PiRL. The proposed framework utilizes maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) loss and domain-adversarial training to encourage the model
to learn participant-invariant representations. Further, a triplet loss, which
constrains the model for inter-class alignment of the representations, is
utilized to optimize the learned representations for downstream health
applications. We evaluated our frameworks on two public datasets related to
physical and mental health, for detecting sleep apnea and stress, respectively.
As preliminary results, we found the proposed approach shows around a 5%
increase in accuracy compared to the baseline.

    <title>Learning and DiSentangling Patient Static Information from Time-series
  Electronic HEalth Record (STEER)</title>
    <summary>  Recent work in machine learning for healthcare has raised concerns about
patient privacy and algorithmic fairness. For example, previous work has shown
that patient self-reported race can be predicted from medical data that does
not explicitly contain racial information. However, the extent of data
identification is unknown, and we lack ways to develop models whose outcomes
are minimally affected by such information. Here we systematically investigated
the ability of time-series electronic health record data to predict patient
static information. We found that not only the raw time-series data, but also
learned representations from machine learning models, can be trained to predict
a variety of static information with area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve as high as 0.851 for biological sex, 0.869 for binarized
age and 0.810 for self-reported race. Such high predictive performance can be
extended to a wide range of comorbidity factors and exists even when the model
was trained for different tasks, using different cohorts, using different model
architectures and databases. Given the privacy and fairness concerns these
findings pose, we develop a variational autoencoder-based approach that learns
a structured latent space to disentangle patient-sensitive attributes from
time-series data. Our work thoroughly investigates the ability of machine
learning models to encode patient static information from time-series
electronic health records and introduces a general approach to protect
patient-sensitive attribute information for downstream tasks.

    <title>Moral Decision-Making in Medical Hybrid Intelligent Systems: A Team
  Design Patterns Approach to the Bias Mitigation and Data Sharing Design
  Problems</title>
    <summary>  Increasing automation in the healthcare sector calls for a Hybrid
Intelligence (HI) approach to closely study and design the collaboration of
humans and autonomous machines. Ensuring that medical HI systems'
decision-making is ethical is key. The use of Team Design Patterns (TDPs) can
advance this goal by describing successful and reusable configurations of
design problems in which decisions have a moral component, as well as through
facilitating communication in multidisciplinary teams designing HI systems. For
this research, TDPs were developed to describe a set of solutions for two
design problems in a medical HI system: (1) mitigating harmful biases in
machine learning algorithms and (2) sharing health and behavioral patient data
with healthcare professionals and system developers. The Socio-Cognitive
Engineering methodology was employed, integrating operational demands, human
factors knowledge, and a technological analysis into a set of TDPs. A survey
was created to assess the usability of the patterns on their understandability,
effectiveness, and generalizability. The results showed that TDPs are a useful
method to unambiguously describe solutions for diverse HI design problems with
a moral component on varying abstraction levels, that are usable by a
heterogeneous group of multidisciplinary researchers. Additionally, results
indicated that the SCE approach and the developed questionnaire are suitable
methods for creating and assessing TDPs. The study concludes with a set of
proposed improvements to TDPs, including their integration with Interaction
Design Patterns, the inclusion of several additional concepts, and a number of
methodological improvements. Finally, the thesis recommends directions for
future research.

    <title>Representation Learning with Autoencoders for Electronic Health Records:
  A Comparative Study</title>
    <summary>  Increasing volume of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in recent years provides
great opportunities for data scientists to collaborate on different aspects of
healthcare research by applying advanced analytics to these EHR clinical data.
A key requirement however is obtaining meaningful insights from high
dimensional, sparse and complex clinical data. Data science approaches
typically address this challenge by performing feature learning in order to
build more reliable and informative feature representations from clinical data
followed by supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a predictive
modeling approach based on deep learning based feature representations and word
embedding techniques. Our method uses different deep architectures (stacked
sparse autoencoders, deep belief network, adversarial autoencoders and
variational autoencoders) for feature representation in higher-level
abstraction to obtain effective and robust features from EHRs, and then build
prediction models on top of them. Our approach is particularly useful when the
unlabeled data is abundant whereas labeled data is scarce. We investigate the
performance of representation learning through a supervised learning approach.
Our focus is to present a comparative study to evaluate the performance of
different deep architectures through supervised learning and provide insights
in the choice of deep feature representation techniques. Our experiments
demonstrate that for small data sets, stacked sparse autoencoder demonstrates a
superior generality performance in prediction due to sparsity regularization
whereas variational autoencoders outperform the competing approaches for large
data sets due to its capability of learning the representation distribution.

    <title>Positive Unlabeled Learning Selected Not At Random (PULSNAR): class
  proportion estimation when the SCAR assumption does not hold</title>
    <summary>  Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning is a type of semi-supervised binary
classification where the machine learning algorithm differentiates between a
set of positive instances (labeled) and a set of both positive and negative
instances (unlabeled). PU learning has broad applications in settings where
confirmed negatives are unavailable or difficult to obtain, and there is value
in discovering positives among the unlabeled (e.g., viable drugs among untested
compounds). Most PU learning algorithms make the \emph{selected completely at
random} (SCAR) assumption, namely that positives are selected independently of
their features. However, in many real-world applications, such as healthcare,
positives are not SCAR (e.g., severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed),
leading to a poor estimate of the proportion, $\alpha$, of positives among
unlabeled examples and poor model calibration, resulting in an uncertain
decision threshold for selecting positives. PU learning algorithms vary; some
estimate only the proportion, $\alpha$, of positives in the unlabeled set,
while others calculate the probability that each specific unlabeled instance is
positive, and some can do both. We propose two PU learning algorithms to
estimate $\alpha$, calculate calibrated probabilities for PU instances, and
improve classification metrics: i) PULSCAR (positive unlabeled learning
selected completely at random), and ii) PULSNAR (positive unlabeled learning
selected not at random). PULSNAR employs a divide-and-conquer approach to
cluster SNAR positives into subtypes and estimates $\alpha$ for each subtype by
applying PULSCAR to positives from each cluster and all unlabeled. In our
experiments, PULSNAR outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic
and real-world benchmark datasets.

    <title>Learning Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes Using Causal Tree Methods in
  Medicine</title>
    <summary>  Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are used in medicine to tailor sequential
treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common
methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are
typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or
they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern
electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel
methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.
We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,
specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear
relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and
explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts
causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods
using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care
units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative
regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work
improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of
direct relevance for personalized medicine.

    <title>Do Ensembling and Meta-Learning Improve Outlier Detection in Randomized
  Controlled Trials?</title>
    <summary>  Modern multi-centre randomized controlled trials (MCRCTs) collect massive
amounts of tabular data, and are monitored intensively for irregularities by
humans. We began by empirically evaluating 6 modern machine learning-based
outlier detection algorithms on the task of identifying irregular data in 838
datasets from 7 real-world MCRCTs with a total of 77,001 patients from over 44
countries. Our results reinforce key findings from prior work in the outlier
detection literature on data from other domains. Existing algorithms often
succeed at identifying irregularities without any supervision, with at least
one algorithm exhibiting positive performance 70.6% of the time. However,
performance across datasets varies substantially with no single algorithm
performing consistently well, motivating new techniques for unsupervised model
selection or other means of aggregating potentially discordant predictions from
multiple candidate models. We propose the Meta-learned Probabilistic Ensemble
(MePE), a simple algorithm for aggregating the predictions of multiple
unsupervised models, and show that it performs favourably compared to recent
meta-learning approaches for outlier detection model selection. While
meta-learning shows promise, small ensembles outperform all forms of
meta-learning on average, a negative result that may guide the application of
current outlier detection approaches in healthcare and other real-world
domains.

    <title>Leveraging Implicit Expert Knowledge for Non-Circular Machine Learning
  in Sepsis Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Sepsis is the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units.
Moreover, a delay of antibiotic treatment of patients with severe sepsis by
only few hours is associated with increased mortality. This insight makes
accurate models for early prediction of sepsis a key task in machine learning
for healthcare. Previous approaches have achieved high AUROC by learning from
electronic health records where sepsis labels were defined automatically
following established clinical criteria. We argue that the practice of
incorporating the clinical criteria that are used to automatically define
ground truth sepsis labels as features of severity scoring models is inherently
circular and compromises the validity of the proposed approaches. We propose to
create an independent ground truth for sepsis research by exploiting implicit
knowledge of clinical practitioners via an electronic questionnaire which
records attending physicians' daily judgements of patients' sepsis status. We
show that despite its small size, our dataset allows to achieve
state-of-the-art AUROC scores. An inspection of learned weights for
standardized features of the linear model lets us infer potentially surprising
feature contributions and allows to interpret seemingly counterintuitive
findings.

    <title>On Learning from Label Proportions</title>
    <summary>  Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) is a learning setting, where the
training data is provided in groups, or "bags", and only the proportion of each
class in each bag is known. The task is to learn a model to predict the class
labels of the individual instances. LLP has broad applications in political
science, marketing, healthcare, and computer vision. This work answers the
fundamental question, when and why LLP is possible, by introducing a general
framework, Empirical Proportion Risk Minimization (EPRM). EPRM learns an
instance label classifier to match the given label proportions on the training
data. Our result is based on a two-step analysis. First, we provide a VC bound
on the generalization error of the bag proportions. We show that the bag sample
complexity is only mildly sensitive to the bag size. Second, we show that under
some mild assumptions, good bag proportion prediction guarantees good instance
label prediction. The results together provide a formal guarantee that the
individual labels can indeed be learned in the LLP setting. We discuss
applications of the analysis, including justification of LLP algorithms,
learning with population proportions, and a paradigm for learning algorithms
with privacy guarantees. We also demonstrate the feasibility of LLP based on a
case study in real-world setting: predicting income based on census data.

    <title>Benchmarking AutoML Frameworks for Disease Prediction Using Medical
  Claims</title>
    <summary>  We ascertain and compare the performances of AutoML tools on large, highly
imbalanced healthcare datasets.
  We generated a large dataset using historical administrative claims including
demographic information and flags for disease codes in four different time
windows prior to 2019. We then trained three AutoML tools on this dataset to
predict six different disease outcomes in 2019 and evaluated model performances
on several metrics.
  The AutoML tools showed improvement from the baseline random forest model but
did not differ significantly from each other. All models recorded low area
under the precision-recall curve and failed to predict true positives while
keeping the true negative rate high. Model performance was not directly related
to prevalence. We provide a specific use-case to illustrate how to select a
threshold that gives the best balance between true and false positive rates, as
this is an important consideration in medical applications.
  Healthcare datasets present several challenges for AutoML tools, including
large sample size, high imbalance, and limitations in the available features
types. Improvements in scalability, combinations of imbalance-learning
resampling and ensemble approaches, and curated feature selection are possible
next steps to achieve better performance.
  Among the three explored, no AutoML tool consistently outperforms the rest in
terms of predictive performance. The performances of the models in this study
suggest that there may be room for improvement in handling medical claims data.
Finally, selection of the optimal prediction threshold should be guided by the
specific practical application.

    <title>MedAttacker: Exploring Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Risk Prediction
  Models in Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been broadly adopted in health risk
prediction to provide healthcare diagnoses and treatments. To evaluate their
robustness, existing research conducts adversarial attacks in the
white/gray-box setting where model parameters are accessible. However, a more
realistic black-box adversarial attack is ignored even though most real-world
models are trained with private data and released as black-box services on the
cloud. To fill this gap, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack
method against health risk prediction models named MedAttacker to investigate
their vulnerability. MedAttacker addresses the challenges brought by EHR data
via two steps: hierarchical position selection which selects the attacked
positions in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and substitute selection
which identifies substitute with a score-based principle. Particularly, by
considering the temporal context inside EHRs, it initializes its RL position
selection policy by using the contribution score of each visit and the saliency
score of each code, which can be well integrated with the deterministic
substitute selection process decided by the score changes. In experiments,
MedAttacker consistently achieves the highest average success rate and even
outperforms a recent white-box EHR adversarial attack technique in certain
cases when attacking three advanced health risk prediction models in the
black-box setting across multiple real-world datasets. In addition, based on
the experiment results we include a discussion on defending EHR adversarial
attacks.

    <title>Forecasting labels under distribution-shift for machine-guided sequence
  design</title>
    <summary>  The ability to design and optimize biological sequences with specific
functionalities would unlock enormous value in technology and healthcare. In
recent years, machine learning-guided sequence design has progressed this goal
significantly, though validating designed sequences in the lab or clinic takes
many months and substantial labor. It is therefore valuable to assess the
likelihood that a designed set contains sequences of the desired quality (which
often lies outside the label distribution in our training data) before
committing resources to an experiment. Forecasting, a prominent concept in many
domains where feedback can be delayed (e.g. elections), has not been used or
studied in the context of sequence design. Here we propose a method to guide
decision-making that forecasts the performance of high-throughput libraries
(e.g. containing $10^5$ unique variants) based on estimates provided by models,
providing a posterior for the distribution of labels in the library. We show
that our method outperforms baselines that naively use model scores to estimate
library performance, which are the only tool available today for this purpose.

    <title>The challenges of deploying artificial intelligence models in a rapidly
  evolving pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2, emerged into a world being rapidly transformed by artificial
intelligence (AI) based on big data, computational power and neural networks.
The gaze of these networks has in recent years turned increasingly towards
applications in healthcare. It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global
disease propagating health and economic devastation, should capture the
attention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and
industry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been
proposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including
disease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely
to continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,
industries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has
been the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This
correspondence focuses on exploring potential reasons behind the lack of
successful adoption of AI models developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and
prognosis, in front-line healthcare services. We highlight the moving clinical
needs that models have had to address at different stages of the epidemic, and
explain the importance of translating models to reflect local healthcare
environments. We argue that both basic and applied research are essential to
accelerate the potential of AI models, and this is particularly so during a
rapidly evolving pandemic. This perspective on the response to COVID-19, may
provide a glimpse into how the global scientific community should react to
combat future disease outbreaks more effectively.

    <title>Evaluating the Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  In the era of advanced technologies, mobile devices are equipped with
computing and sensing capabilities that gather excessive amounts of data. These
amounts of data are suitable for training different learning models. Cooperated
with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), these learning models empower numerous
useful applications, e.g., image processing, speech recognition, healthcare,
vehicular network and many more. Traditionally, Machine Learning (ML)
approaches require data to be centralised in cloud-based data-centres. However,
this data is often large in quantity and privacy-sensitive which prevents
logging into these data-centres for training the learning models. In turn, this
results in critical issues of high latency and communication inefficiency.
Recently, in light of new privacy legislations in many countries, the concept
of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, mobile users are
empowered to learn a global model by aggregating their local models, without
sharing the privacy-sensitive data. Usually, these mobile users have slow
network connections to the data-centre where the global model is maintained.
Moreover, in a complex and large scale network, heterogeneous devices that have
various energy constraints are involved. This raises the challenge of
communication cost when implementing FL at large scale. To this end, in this
research, we begin with the fundamentals of FL, and then, we highlight the
recent FL algorithms and evaluate their communication efficiency with detailed
comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a set of solutions to alleviate the
existing FL problems both from communication perspective and privacy
perspective.

    <title>Evaluation of Inference Attack Models for Deep Learning on Medical Data</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning has attracted broad interest in healthcare and medical
communities. However, there has been little research into the privacy issues
created by deep networks trained for medical applications. Recently developed
inference attack algorithms indicate that images and text records can be
reconstructed by malicious parties that have the ability to query deep
networks. This gives rise to the concern that medical images and electronic
health records containing sensitive patient information are vulnerable to these
attacks. This paper aims to attract interest from researchers in the medical
deep learning community to this important problem. We evaluate two prominent
inference attack models, namely, attribute inference attack and model inversion
attack. We show that they can reconstruct real-world medical images and
clinical reports with high fidelity. We then investigate how to protect
patients' privacy using defense mechanisms, such as label perturbation and
model perturbation. We provide a comparison of attack results between the
original and the medical deep learning models with defenses. The experimental
evaluations show that our proposed defense approaches can effectively reduce
the potential privacy leakage of medical deep learning from the inference
attacks.

    <title>DABS: A Domain-Agnostic Benchmark for Self-Supervised Learning</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised learning algorithms, including BERT and SimCLR, have enabled
significant strides in fields like natural language processing, computer
vision, and speech processing. However, these algorithms are domain-specific,
meaning that new self-supervised learning algorithms must be developed for each
new setting, including myriad healthcare, scientific, and multimodal domains.
To catalyze progress toward domain-agnostic methods, we introduce DABS: a
Domain-Agnostic Benchmark for Self-supervised learning. To perform well on
DABS, an algorithm is evaluated on seven diverse domains: natural images,
multichannel sensor data, English text, speech recordings, multilingual text,
chest x-rays, and images with text descriptions. Each domain contains an
unlabeled dataset for pretraining; the model is then is scored based on its
downstream performance on a set of labeled tasks in the domain. We also present
e-Mix and ShED: two baseline domain-agnostic algorithms; their relatively
modest performance demonstrates that significant progress is needed before
self-supervised learning is an out-of-the-box solution for arbitrary domains.
Code for benchmark datasets and baseline algorithms is available at

  Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Consider the problem of improving the estimation of conditional average
treatment effects (CATE) for a target domain of interest by leveraging related
information from a source domain with a different feature space. This
heterogeneous transfer learning problem for CATE estimation is ubiquitous in
areas such as healthcare where we may wish to evaluate the effectiveness of a
treatment for a new patient population for which different clinical covariates
and limited data are available. In this paper, we address this problem by
introducing several building blocks that use representation learning to handle
the heterogeneous feature spaces and a flexible multi-task architecture with
shared and private layers to transfer information between potential outcome
functions across domains. Then, we show how these building blocks can be used
to recover transfer learning equivalents of the standard CATE learners. On a
new semi-synthetic data simulation benchmark for heterogeneous transfer
learning we not only demonstrate performance improvements of our heterogeneous
transfer causal effect learners across datasets, but also provide insights into
the differences between these learners from a transfer perspective.

    <title>Trompt: Towards a Better Deep Neural Network for Tabular Data</title>
    <summary>  Tabular data is arguably one of the most commonly used data structures in
various practical domains, including finance, healthcare and e-commerce. The
inherent heterogeneity allows tabular data to store rich information. However,
based on a recently published tabular benchmark, we can see deep neural
networks still fall behind tree-based models on tabular datasets. In this
paper, we propose Trompt--which stands for Tabular Prompt--a novel architecture
inspired by prompt learning of language models. The essence of prompt learning
is to adjust a large pre-trained model through a set of prompts outside the
model without directly modifying the model. Based on this idea, Trompt
separates the learning strategy of tabular data into two parts. The first part,
analogous to pre-trained models, focus on learning the intrinsic information of
a table. The second part, analogous to prompts, focus on learning the
variations among samples. Trompt is evaluated with the benchmark mentioned
above. The experimental results demonstrate that Trompt outperforms
state-of-the-art deep neural networks and is comparable to tree-based models.

    <title>Revolutionizing Disease Diagnosis: A Microservices-Based Architecture
  for Privacy-Preserving and Efficient IoT Data Analytics Using Federated
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning-based disease diagnosis applications are essential for accurate
diagnosis at various disease stages. However, using personal data exposes
traditional centralized learning systems to privacy concerns. On the other
hand, by positioning processing resources closer to the device and enabling
more effective data analyses, a distributed computing paradigm has the
potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis. Scalable architectures for data
analytics are also crucial in healthcare, where data analytics results must
have low latency and high dependability and reliability. This study proposes a
microservices-based approach for IoT data analytics systems to satisfy privacy
and performance requirements by arranging entities into fine-grained, loosely
connected, and reusable collections. Our approach relies on federated learning,
which can increase disease diagnosis accuracy while protecting data privacy.
Additionally, we employ transfer learning to obtain more efficient models.
Using more than 5800 chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection from a publicly
available dataset, we ran experiments to assess the effectiveness of our
approach. Our experiments reveal that our approach performs better in
identifying pneumonia than other cutting-edge technologies, demonstrating our
approach's promising potential detection performance.

    <title>Transfer Learning in Human Activity Recognition: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research
area, owing to its applications in smart environments, assisted living,
fitness, healthcare, etc. Recently, deep learning based end-to-end training has
resulted in state-of-the-art performance in domains such as computer vision and
natural language, where large amounts of annotated data are available. However,
large quantities of annotated data are not available for sensor-based HAR.
Moreover, the real-world settings on which the HAR is performed differ in terms
of sensor modalities, classification tasks, and target users. To address this
problem, transfer learning has been employed extensively. In this survey, we
focus on these transfer learning methods in the application domains of smart
home and wearables-based HAR. In particular, we provide a problem-solution
perspective by categorizing and presenting the works in terms of their
contributions and the challenges they address. We also present an updated view
of the state-of-the-art for both application domains. Based on our analysis of
205 papers, we highlight the gaps in the literature and provide a roadmap for
addressing them. This survey provides a reference to the HAR community, by
summarizing the existing works and providing a promising research agenda.

    <title>The Consequences of the Framing of Machine Learning Risk Prediction
  Models: Evaluation of Sepsis in General Wards</title>
    <summary>  Objectives: To evaluate the consequences of the framing of machine learning
risk prediction models. We evaluate how framing affects model performance and
model learning in four different approaches previously applied in published
artificial-intelligence (AI) models.
  Setting and participants: We analysed structured secondary healthcare data
from 221,283 citizens from four Danish municipalities who were 18 years of age
or older.
  Results: The four models had similar population level performance (a mean
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 to 0.82), in
contrast to the mean average precision, which varied greatly from 0.007 to
0.385. Correspondingly, the percentage of missing values also varied between
framing approaches. The on-clinical-demand framing, which involved samples for
each time the clinicians made an early warning score assessment, showed the
lowest percentage of missing values among the vital sign parameters, and this
model was also able to learn more temporal dependencies than the others. The
Shapley additive explanations demonstrated opposing interpretations of SpO2 in
the prediction of sepsis as a consequence of differentially framed models.
  Conclusions: The profound consequences of framing mandate attention from
clinicians and AI developers, as the understanding and reporting of framing are
pivotal to the successful development and clinical implementation of future AI
technology. Model framing must reflect the expected clinical environment. The
importance of proper problem framing is by no means exclusive to sepsis
prediction and applies to most clinical risk prediction models.

    <title>Learning Linguistic Biomarkers for Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment
  using Compound Skip-grams</title>
    <summary>  Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is currently a challenge as
existing diagnostic criteria rely on neuropsychological examinations. Automated
Machine Learning (ML) models that are trained on verbal utterances of MCI
patients can aid diagnosis. Using a combination of skip-gram features, our
model learned several linguistic biomarkers to distinguish between 19 patients
with MCI and 19 healthy control individuals from the DementiaBank language
transcript clinical dataset. Results show that a model with compound of
skip-grams has better AUC and could help ML prediction on small MCI data
sample.

    <title>Discovering Invariances in Healthcare Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  We study the invariance characteristics of pre-trained predictive models by
empirically learning transformations on the input that leave the prediction
function approximately unchanged. To learn invariant transformations, we
minimize the Wasserstein distance between the predictive distribution
conditioned on the data instances and the predictive distribution conditioned
on the transformed data instances. To avoid finding degenerate or perturbative
transformations, we add a similarity regularization to discourage similarity
between the data and its transformed values. We theoretically analyze the
correctness of the algorithm and the structure of the solutions. Applying the
proposed technique to clinical time series data, we discover variables that
commonly-used LSTM models do not rely on for their prediction, especially when
the LSTM is trained to be adversarially robust. We also analyze the invariances
of BioBERT on clinical notes and discover words that it is invariant to.

    <title>PaDPaF: Partial Disentanglement with Partially-Federated GANs</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning has become a popular machine learning paradigm with many
potential real-life applications, including recommendation systems, the
Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and self-driving cars. Though most
current applications focus on classification-based tasks, learning personalized
generative models remains largely unexplored, and their benefits in the
heterogeneous setting still need to be better understood. This work proposes a
novel architecture combining global client-agnostic and local client-specific
generative models. We show that using standard techniques for training
federated models, our proposed model achieves privacy and personalization by
implicitly disentangling the globally consistent representation (i.e. content)
from the client-dependent variations (i.e. style). Using such decomposition,
personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while preserving the
given style of the client and can predict the labels for all clients with high
accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global content features.
Furthermore, disentanglement enables other essential applications, such as data
anonymization, by sharing only the content. Extensive experimental evaluation
corroborates our findings, and we also discuss a theoretical motivation for the
proposed approach.

    <title>Decoupled Marked Temporal Point Process using Neural Ordinary
  Differential Equations</title>
    <summary>  A Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) is a stochastic process whose
realization is a set of event-time data. MTPP is often used to understand
complex dynamics of asynchronous temporal events such as money transaction,
social media, healthcare, etc. Recent studies have utilized deep neural
networks to capture complex temporal dependencies of events and generate
embedding that aptly represent the observed events. While most previous studies
focus on the inter-event dependencies and their representations, how individual
events influence the overall dynamics over time has been under-explored. In
this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles
characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from
different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while
simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density
estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of
disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art
methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for
potential applications.

    <title>EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for
  Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health
Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by
several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and
insufficient context length of these models pose significant obstacles for
hospitals in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data.
Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical
task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these
models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting,
lacking the flexibility to perform well across both. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the
Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to four times longer than
previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel
approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MTF) for EHR data, which enables
EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning
phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization.
Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify
integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source
Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR
foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and
interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that
EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks
and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.

    <title>Sparse Hierarchical Tucker Factorization and its Application to
  Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new tensor factorization method, called the Sparse
Hierarchical-Tucker (Sparse H-Tucker), for sparse and high-order data tensors.
Sparse H-Tucker is inspired by its namesake, the classical Hierarchical Tucker
method, which aims to compute a tree-structured factorization of an input data
set that may be readily interpreted by a domain expert. However, Sparse
H-Tucker uses a nested sampling technique to overcome a key scalability problem
in Hierarchical Tucker, which is the creation of an unwieldy intermediate dense
core tensor; the result of our approach is a faster, more space-efficient, and
more accurate method. We extensively test our method on a real healthcare
dataset, which is collected from 30K patients and results in an 18th order
sparse data tensor. Unlike competing methods, Sparse H-Tucker can analyze the
full data set on a single multi-threaded machine. It can also do so more
accurately and in less time than the state-of-the-art: on a 12th order subset
of the input data, Sparse H-Tucker is 18x more accurate and 7.5x faster than a
previously state-of-the-art method. Even for analyzing low order tensors (e.g.,
4-order), our method requires close to an order of magnitude less time and over
two orders of magnitude less memory, as compared to traditional tensor
factorization methods such as CP and Tucker. Moreover, we observe that Sparse
H-Tucker scales nearly linearly in the number of non-zero tensor elements. The
resulting model also provides an interpretable disease hierarchy, which is
confirmed by a clinical expert.

    <title>Asynchronous Multi-Task Learning</title>
    <summary>  Many real-world machine learning applications involve several learning tasks
which are inter-related. For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn a
predictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for each
hospital may be different because of the inherent differences in the
distributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closely
related because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease.
By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm
performs inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization
performance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at different
locations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide a
data-centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such as
high data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTL
framework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address the
aforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait for
collecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposed
method is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some task
nodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from this
framework, including the low-rank MTL for shared subspace learning. Empirical
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency
and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

    <title>Explainable artificial intelligence for Healthcare applications using
  Random Forest Classifier with LIME and SHAP</title>
    <summary>  With the advances in computationally efficient artificial Intelligence (AI)
techniques and their numerous applications in our everyday life, there is a
pressing need to understand the computational details hidden in black box AI
techniques such as most popular machine learning and deep learning techniques;
through more detailed explanations. The origin of explainable AI (xAI) is
coined from these challenges and recently gained more attention by the
researchers by adding explainability comprehensively in traditional AI systems.
This leads to develop an appropriate framework for successful applications of
xAI in real life scenarios with respect to innovations, risk mitigation,
ethical issues and logical values to the users. In this book chapter, an
in-depth analysis of several xAI frameworks and methods including LIME (Local
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) are provided. Random Forest Classifier as black box AI is used on
a publicly available Diabetes symptoms dataset with LIME and SHAP for better
interpretations. The results obtained are interesting in terms of transparency,
valid and trustworthiness in diabetes disease prediction.

    <title>An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI</title>
    <summary>  What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the
future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous
amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around
2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other
established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks
are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas,
from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in
academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical
imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare
in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent
advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical
image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast
expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but
put particular focus on deep learning in MRI.
  Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with
pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied
to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from
segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people
interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of machine
learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources,
state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems
related medical imaging.

    <title>Socially assistive robots' deployment in healthcare settings: a global
  perspective</title>
    <summary>  One of the major areas where social robots are finding their place in society
is for healthcare-related applications. Yet, very little research has mapped
the deployment of socially assistive robots (SARs) in real settings. Using a
documentary research method, we were able to trace back 279 experiences of SARs
deployments in hospitals, elderly care centers, occupational health centers,
private homes, and educational institutions worldwide from 33 different
countries, and involving 52 different robot models. We retrieved, analyzed, and
classified the functions that SARs develop in these experiences, the areas in
which they are deployed, the principal manufacturers, and the robot models that
are being adopted. The functions we identified for SARs are entertainment,
companionship, telepresence, edutainment, providing general and personalized
information or advice, monitoring, promotion of physical exercise and
rehabilitation, testing and pre-diagnosis, delivering supplies, patient
registration, giving location indications, patient simulator, protective
measure enforcement, medication and well-being adherence, translating and
having conversations in multiple languages, psychological therapy, patrolling,
interacting with digital devices, and disinfection. Our work provides an
in-depth picture of the current state of the art of SARs' deployment in real
scenarios for healthcare-related applications and contributes to understanding
better the role of these machines in the healthcare sector.

    <title>PANDA: Facilitating Usable AI Development</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have
created a general perception that AI could be used to solve complex problems,
and in some situations over-hyped as a tool that can be so easily used.
Unfortunately, the barrier to realization of mass adoption of AI on various
business domains is too high because most domain experts have no background in
AI. Developing AI applications involves multiple phases, namely data
preparation, application modeling, and product deployment. The effort of AI
research has been spent mostly on new AI models (in the model training stage)
to improve the performance of benchmark tasks such as image recognition. Many
other factors such as usability, efficiency and security of AI have not been
well addressed, and therefore form a barrier to democratizing AI. Further, for
many real world applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving,
learning via huge amounts of possibility exploration is not feasible since
humans are involved. In many complex applications such as healthcare, subject
matter experts (e.g. Clinicians) are the ones who appreciate the importance of
features that affect health, and their knowledge together with existing
knowledge bases are critical to the end results. In this paper, we take a new
perspective on developing AI solutions, and present a solution for making AI
usable. We hope that this resolution will enable all subject matter experts
(eg. Clinicians) to exploit AI like data scientists.

    <title>Reconstruction of Patient-Specific Confounders in AI-based Radiologic
  Image Interpretation using Generative Pretraining</title>
    <summary>  Detecting misleading patterns in automated diagnostic assistance systems,
such as those powered by Artificial Intelligence, is critical to ensuring their
reliability, particularly in healthcare. Current techniques for evaluating deep
learning models cannot visualize confounding factors at a diagnostic level.
Here, we propose a self-conditioned diffusion model termed DiffChest and train
it on a dataset of 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients from
multiple healthcare centers in the United States and Europe. DiffChest explains
classifications on a patient-specific level and visualizes the confounding
factors that may mislead the model. We found high inter-reader agreement when
evaluating DiffChest's capability to identify treatment-related confounders,
with Fleiss' Kappa values of 0.8 or higher across most imaging findings.
Confounders were accurately captured with 11.1% to 100% prevalence rates.
Furthermore, our pretraining process optimized the model to capture the most
relevant information from the input radiographs. DiffChest achieved excellent
diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing 11 chest conditions, such as pleural
effusion and cardiac insufficiency, and at least sufficient diagnostic accuracy
for the remaining conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of
pretraining based on diffusion models in medical image classification,
specifically in providing insights into confounding factors and model
robustness.

    <title>An Empirical Framework for Domain Generalization in Clinical Settings</title>
    <summary>  Clinical machine learning models experience significantly degraded
performance in datasets not seen during training, e.g., new hospitals or
populations. Recent developments in domain generalization offer a promising
solution to this problem by creating models that learn invariances across
environments. In this work, we benchmark the performance of eight domain
generalization methods on multi-site clinical time series and medical imaging
data. We introduce a framework to induce synthetic but realistic domain shifts
and sampling bias to stress-test these methods over existing non-healthcare
benchmarks. We find that current domain generalization methods do not
consistently achieve significant gains in out-of-distribution performance over
empirical risk minimization on real-world medical imaging data, in line with
prior work on general imaging datasets. However, a subset of realistic
induced-shift scenarios in clinical time series data do exhibit limited
performance gains. We characterize these scenarios in detail, and recommend
best practices for domain generalization in the clinical setting.

    <title>Evaluating Model Performance in Medical Datasets Over Time</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) models deployed in healthcare systems must face data
drawn from continually evolving environments. However, researchers proposing
such models typically evaluate them in a time-agnostic manner, splitting
datasets according to patients sampled randomly throughout the entire study
time period. This work proposes the Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time
(EMDOT) framework, which evaluates the performance of a model class across
time. Inspired by the concept of backtesting, EMDOT simulates possible training
procedures that practitioners might have been able to execute at each point in
time and evaluates the resulting models on all future time points. Evaluating
both linear and more complex models on six distinct medical data sources
(tabular and imaging), we show how depending on the dataset, using all
historical data may be ideal in many cases, whereas using a window of the most
recent data could be advantageous in others. In datasets where models suffer
from sudden degradations in performance, we investigate plausible explanations
for these shocks. We release the EMDOT package to help facilitate further works
in deployment-oriented evaluation over time.

    <title>Federated Machine Learning for Intelligent IoT via Reconfigurable
  Intelligent Surface</title>
    <summary>  Intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) will be transformative with the
advancement of artificial intelligence and high-dimensional data analysis,
shifting from "connected things" to "connected intelligence". This shall
unleash the full potential of intelligent IoT in a plethora of exciting
applications, such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, healthcare,
robotics, and supply chain finance. These applications drive the need of
developing revolutionary computation, communication and artificial intelligence
technologies that can make low-latency decisions with massive real-time data.
To this end, federated machine learning, as a disruptive technology, is emerged
to distill intelligence from the data at network edge, while guaranteeing
device privacy and data security. However, the limited communication bandwidth
is a key bottleneck of model aggregation for federated machine learning over
radio channels. In this article, we shall develop an over-the-air computation
based communication-efficient federated machine learning framework for
intelligent IoT networks via exploiting the waveform superposition property of
a multi-access channel. Reconfigurable intelligent surface is further leveraged
to reduce the model aggregation error via enhancing the signal strength by
reconfiguring the wireless propagation environments.

    <title>A Survey on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Data Processing and
  Analytics</title>
    <summary>  Data processing and analytics are fundamental and pervasive. Algorithms play
a vital role in data processing and analytics where many algorithm designs have
incorporated heuristics and general rules from human knowledge and experience
to improve their effectiveness. Recently, reinforcement learning, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in particular, is increasingly explored and
exploited in many areas because it can learn better strategies in complicated
environments it is interacting with than statically designed algorithms.
Motivated by this trend, we provide a comprehensive review of recent works
focusing on utilizing DRL to improve data processing and analytics. First, we
present an introduction to key concepts, theories, and methods in DRL. Next, we
discuss DRL deployment on database systems, facilitating data processing and
analytics in various aspects, including data organization, scheduling, tuning,
and indexing. Then, we survey the application of DRL in data processing and
analytics, ranging from data preparation, natural language processing to
healthcare, fintech, etc. Finally, we discuss important open challenges and
future research directions of using DRL in data processing and analytics.

    <title>Learning Disentangled Representations in the Imaging Domain</title>
    <summary>  Disentangled representation learning has been proposed as an approach to
learning general representations even in the absence of, or with limited,
supervision. A good general representation can be fine-tuned for new target
tasks using modest amounts of data, or used directly in unseen domains
achieving remarkable performance in the corresponding task. This alleviation of
the data and annotation requirements offers tantalising prospects for
applications in computer vision and healthcare. In this tutorial paper, we
motivate the need for disentangled representations, revisit key concepts, and
describe practical building blocks and criteria for learning such
representations. We survey applications in medical imaging emphasising choices
made in exemplar key works, and then discuss links to computer vision
applications. We conclude by presenting limitations, challenges, and
opportunities.

    <title>Inverse Contextual Bandits: Learning How Behavior Evolves over Time</title>
    <summary>  Understanding a decision-maker's priorities by observing their behavior is
critical for transparency and accountability in decision processes, such as in
healthcare. Though conventional approaches to policy learning almost invariably
assume stationarity in behavior, this is hardly true in practice: Medical
practice is constantly evolving as clinical professionals fine-tune their
knowledge over time. For instance, as the medical community's understanding of
organ transplantations has progressed over the years, a pertinent question is:
How have actual organ allocation policies been evolving? To give an answer, we
desire a policy learning method that provides interpretable representations of
decision-making, in particular capturing an agent's non-stationary knowledge of
the world, as well as operating in an offline manner. First, we model the
evolving behavior of decision-makers in terms of contextual bandits, and
formalize the problem of Inverse Contextual Bandits (ICB). Second, we propose
two concrete algorithms as solutions, learning parametric and nonparametric
representations of an agent's behavior. Finally, using both real and simulated
data for liver transplantations, we illustrate the applicability and
explainability of our method, as well as benchmarking and validating its
accuracy.

    <title>Federated Learning with Convex Global and Local Constraints</title>
    <summary>  In practice, many machine learning (ML) problems come with constraints, and
their applied domains involve distributed sensitive data that cannot be shared
with others, e.g., in healthcare. Collaborative learning in such practical
scenarios entails federated learning (FL) for ML problems with constraints, or
FL with constraints for short. Despite the extensive developments of FL
techniques in recent years, these techniques only deal with unconstrained FL
problems or FL problems with simple constraints that are amenable to easy
projections. There is little work dealing with FL problems with general
constraints. To fill this gap, we take the first step toward building an
algorithmic framework for solving FL problems with general constraints. In
particular, we propose a new FL algorithm for constrained ML problems based on
the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) method. Assuming convex objective and
convex constraints plus other mild conditions, we establish the worst-case
complexity of the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments show the
effectiveness of our algorithm in performing Neyman-Pearson classification and
fairness-aware learning with nonconvex constraints, in an FL setting.

    <title>Artificial Intelligence-Based Methods for Fusion of Electronic Health
  Records and Imaging Data</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal
data sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides
optimal personalized healthcare. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies, particularly machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these
different data modalities to provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this
scoping review, we focus on synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses
AI techniques to fuse multimodal medical data for different clinical
applications. More specifically, we focus on studies that only fused EHR with
medical imaging data to develop various AI methods for clinical applications.
We present a comprehensive analysis of the various fusion strategies, the
diseases and clinical outcomes for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML
algorithms used to perform multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and
the available multimodal medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR
guidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve
relevant studies. We extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the
inclusion criteria. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding
raw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine
learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the
multimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early
fusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning
(22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed
traditional single-modality models for the same task. Disease diagnosis and
prediction were the most common clinical outcomes (reported in 20 and 10
studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome perspective.

    <title>MH-pFLGB: Model Heterogeneous personalized Federated Learning via Global
  Bypass for Medical Image Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In the evolving application of medical artificial intelligence, federated
learning is notable for its ability to protect training data privacy. Federated
learning facilitates collaborative model development without the need to share
local data from healthcare institutions. Yet, the statistical and system
heterogeneity among these institutions poses substantial challenges, which
affects the effectiveness of federated learning and hampers the exchange of
information between clients. To address these issues, we introduce a novel
approach, MH-pFLGB, which employs a global bypass strategy to mitigate the
reliance on public datasets and navigate the complexities of non-IID data
distributions. Our method enhances traditional federated learning by
integrating a global bypass model, which would share the information among the
clients, but also serves as part of the network to enhance the performance on
each client. Additionally, MH-pFLGB provides a feature fusion module to better
combine the local and global features. We validate \model{}'s effectiveness and
adaptability through extensive testing on different medical tasks,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

    <title>Bayesian Inverse Transition Learning for Offline Settings</title>
    <summary>  Offline Reinforcement learning is commonly used for sequential
decision-making in domains such as healthcare and education, where the rewards
are known and the transition dynamics $T$ must be estimated on the basis of
batch data. A key challenge for all tasks is how to learn a reliable estimate
of the transition dynamics $T$ that produce near-optimal policies that are safe
enough so that they never take actions that are far away from the best action
with respect to their value functions and informative enough so that they
communicate the uncertainties they have. Using data from an expert, we propose
a new constraint-based approach that captures our desiderata for reliably
learning a posterior distribution of the transition dynamics $T$ that is free
from gradients. Our results demonstrate that by using our constraints, we learn
a high-performing policy, while considerably reducing the policy's variance
over different datasets. We also explain how combining uncertainty estimation
with these constraints can help us infer a partial ranking of actions that
produce higher returns, and helps us infer safer and more informative policies
for planning.

    <title>AI Techniques for Cone Beam Computed Tomography in Dentistry: Trends and
  Practices</title>
    <summary>  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a popular imaging modality in
dentistry for diagnosing and planning treatment for a variety of oral diseases
with the ability to produce detailed, three-dimensional images of the teeth,
jawbones, and surrounding structures. CBCT imaging has emerged as an essential
diagnostic tool in dentistry. CBCT imaging has seen significant improvements in
terms of its diagnostic value, as well as its accuracy and efficiency, with the
most recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper
reviews recent AI trends and practices in dental CBCT imaging. AI has been used
for lesion detection, malocclusion classification, measurement of buccal bone
thickness, and classification and segmentation of teeth, alveolar bones,
mandibles, landmarks, contours, and pharyngeal airways using CBCT images.
Mainly machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and
super-resolution techniques are used for these tasks. This review focuses on
the potential of AI techniques to transform CBCT imaging in dentistry, which
would improve both diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, we discuss the
challenges and limitations of artificial intelligence in dentistry and CBCT
imaging.

    <title>Applications of 0-1 Neural Networks in Prescription and Prediction</title>
    <summary>  A key challenge in medical decision making is learning treatment policies for
patients with limited observational data. This challenge is particularly
evident in personalized healthcare decision-making, where models need to take
into account the intricate relationships between patient characteristics,
treatment options, and health outcomes. To address this, we introduce
prescriptive networks (PNNs), shallow 0-1 neural networks trained with mixed
integer programming that can be used with counterfactual estimation to optimize
policies in medium data settings. These models offer greater interpretability
than deep neural networks and can encode more complex policies than common
models such as decision trees. We show that PNNs can outperform existing
methods in both synthetic data experiments and in a case study of assigning
treatments for postpartum hypertension. In particular, PNNs are shown to
produce policies that could reduce peak blood pressure by 5.47 mm Hg (p=0.02)
over existing clinical practice, and by 2 mm Hg (p=0.01) over the next best
prescriptive modeling technique. Moreover PNNs were more likely than all other
models to correctly identify clinically significant features while existing
models relied on potentially dangerous features such as patient insurance
information and race that could lead to bias in treatment.

    <title>Data Encoding For Healthcare Data Democratisation and Information
  Leakage Prevention</title>
    <summary>  The lack of data democratization and information leakage from trained models
hinder the development and acceptance of robust deep learning-based healthcare
solutions. This paper argues that irreversible data encoding can provide an
effective solution to achieve data democratization without violating the
privacy constraints imposed on healthcare data and clinical models. An ideal
encoding framework transforms the data into a new space where it is
imperceptible to a manual or computational inspection. However, encoded data
should preserve the semantics of the original data such that deep learning
models can be trained effectively. This paper hypothesizes the characteristics
of the desired encoding framework and then exploits random projections and
random quantum encoding to realize this framework for dense and longitudinal or
time-series data. Experimental evaluation highlights that models trained on
encoded time-series data effectively uphold the information bottleneck
principle and hence, exhibit lesser information leakage from trained models.

    <title>Development of Interpretable Machine Learning Models to Detect
  Arrhythmia based on ECG Data</title>
    <summary>  The analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be time consuming as it
is performed manually by cardiologists. Therefore, automation through machine
learning (ML) classification is being increasingly proposed which would allow
ML models to learn the features of a heartbeat and detect abnormalities. The
lack of interpretability hinders the application of Deep Learning in
healthcare. Through interpretability of these models, we would understand how a
machine learning algorithm makes its decisions and what patterns are being
followed for classification. This thesis builds Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers based on state-of-the-art
models and compares their performance and interpretability to shallow
classifiers. Here, both global and local interpretability methods are exploited
to understand the interaction between dependent and independent variables
across the entire dataset and to examine model decisions in each sample,
respectively. Partial Dependence Plots, Shapley Additive Explanations,
Permutation Feature Importance, and Gradient Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-Cam) are the four interpretability techniques implemented on time-series
ML models classifying ECG rhythms. In particular, we exploit Grad-Cam, which is
a local interpretability technique and examine whether its interpretability
varies between correctly and incorrectly classified ECG beats within each
class. Furthermore, the classifiers are evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation
and Leave Groups Out techniques, and we use non-parametric statistical testing
to examine whether differences are significant. It was found that Grad-CAM was
the most effective interpretability technique at explaining predictions of
proposed CNN and LSTM models. We concluded that all high performing classifiers
looked at the QRS complex of the ECG rhythm when making predictions.

    <title>Benchmark and Best Practices for Biomedical Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title>
    <summary>  Much of biomedical and healthcare data is encoded in discrete, symbolic form
such as text and medical codes. There is a wealth of expert-curated biomedical
domain knowledge stored in knowledge bases and ontologies, but the lack of
reliable methods for learning knowledge representation has limited their
usefulness in machine learning applications. While text-based representation
learning has significantly improved in recent years through advances in natural
language processing, attempts to learn biomedical concept embeddings so far
have been lacking. A recent family of models called knowledge graph embeddings
have shown promising results on general domain knowledge graphs, and we explore
their capabilities in the biomedical domain. We train several state-of-the-art
knowledge graph embedding models on the SNOMED-CT knowledge graph, provide a
benchmark with comparison to existing methods and in-depth discussion on best
practices, and make a case for the importance of leveraging the
multi-relational nature of knowledge graphs for learning biomedical knowledge
representation. The embeddings, code, and materials will be made available to
the communitY.

    <title>Dual Stage Classification of Hand Gestures using Surface Electromyogram</title>
    <summary>  Surface electromyography (sEMG) is becoming exceeding useful in applications
involving analysis of human motion such as in human-machine interface,
assistive technology, healthcare and prosthetic development. The proposed work
presents a novel dual stage classification approach for classification of
grasping gestures from sEMG signals. A statistical assessment of these
activities is presented to determine the similar characteristics between the
considered activities. Similar activities are grouped together. In the first
stage of classification, an activity is identified as belonging to a group,
which is then further classified as one of the activities within the group in
the second stage of classification. The performance of the proposed approach is
compared to the conventional single stage classification approach in terms of
classification accuracies. The classification accuracies obtained using the
proposed dual stage classification are significantly higher as compared to that
for single stage classification.

    <title>SANSformers: Self-Supervised Forecasting in Electronic Health Records
  with Attention-Free Models</title>
    <summary>  Despite the proven effectiveness of Transformer neural networks across
multiple domains, their performance with Electronic Health Records (EHR) can be
nuanced. The unique, multidimensional sequential nature of EHR data can
sometimes make even simple linear models with carefully engineered features
more competitive. Thus, the advantages of Transformers, such as efficient
transfer learning and improved scalability are not always fully exploited in
EHR applications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SANSformer, an
attention-free sequential model designed with specific inductive biases to
cater for the unique characteristics of EHR data.
  In this work, we aim to forecast the demand for healthcare services, by
predicting the number of patient visits to healthcare facilities. The challenge
amplifies when dealing with divergent patient subgroups, like those with rare
diseases, which are characterized by unique health trajectories and are
typically smaller in size. To address this, we employ a self-supervised
pretraining strategy, Generative Summary Pretraining (GSP), which predicts
future summary statistics based on past health records of a patient. Our models
are pretrained on a health registry of nearly one million patients, then
fine-tuned for specific subgroup prediction tasks, showcasing the potential to
handle the multifaceted nature of EHR data.
  In evaluation, SANSformer consistently surpasses robust EHR baselines, with
our GSP pretraining method notably amplifying model performance, particularly
within smaller patient subgroups. Our results illuminate the promising
potential of tailored attention-free models and self-supervised pretraining in
refining healthcare utilization predictions across various patient
demographics.

    <title>Machine Learning for Utility Prediction in Argument-Based Computational
  Persuasion</title>
    <summary>  Automated persuasion systems (APS) aim to persuade a user to believe
something by entering into a dialogue in which arguments and counterarguments
are exchanged. To maximize the probability that an APS is successful in
persuading a user, it can identify a global policy that will allow it to select
the best arguments it presents at each stage of the dialogue whatever arguments
the user presents. However, in real applications, such as for healthcare, it is
unlikely the utility of the outcome of the dialogue will be the same, or the
exact opposite, for the APS and user. In order to deal with this situation,
games in extended form have been harnessed for argumentation in Bi-party
Decision Theory. This opens new problems that we address in this paper: (1) How
can we use Machine Learning (ML) methods to predict utility functions for
different subpopulations of users? and (2) How can we identify for a new user
the best utility function from amongst those that we have learned? To this
extent, we develop two ML methods, EAI and EDS, that leverage information
coming from the users to predict their utilities. EAI is restricted to a fixed
amount of information, whereas EDS can choose the information that best detects
the subpopulations of a user. We evaluate EAI and EDS in a simulation setting
and in a realistic case study concerning healthy eating habits. Results are
promising in both cases, but EDS is more effective at predicting useful utility
functions.

    <title>Estimation of Personalized Effects Associated With Causal Pathways</title>
    <summary>  The goal of personalized decision making is to map a unit's characteristics
to an action tailored to maximize the expected outcome for that unit. Obtaining
high-quality mappings of this type is the goal of the dynamic regime
literature. In healthcare settings, optimizing policies with respect to a
particular causal pathway may be of interest as well. For example, we may wish
to maximize the chemical effect of a drug given data from an observational
study where the chemical effect of the drug on the outcome is entangled with
the indirect effect mediated by differential adherence. In such cases, we may
wish to optimize the direct effect of a drug, while keeping the indirect effect
to that of some reference treatment. [16] shows how to combine mediation
analysis and dynamic treatment regime ideas to defines policies associated with
causal pathways and counterfactual responses to these policies. In this paper,
we derive a variety of methods for learning high quality policies of this type
from data, in a causal model corresponding to a longitudinal setting of
practical importance. We illustrate our methods via a dataset of HIV patients
undergoing therapy, gathered in the Nigerian PEPFAR program.

    <title>Fair inference on error-prone outcomes</title>
    <summary>  Fair inference in supervised learning is an important and active area of
research, yielding a range of useful methods to assess and account for fairness
criteria when predicting ground truth targets. As shown in recent work,
however, when target labels are error-prone, potential prediction unfairness
can arise from measurement error. In this paper, we show that, when an
error-prone proxy target is used, existing methods to assess and calibrate
fairness criteria do not extend to the true target variable of interest. To
remedy this problem, we suggest a framework resulting from the combination of
two existing literatures: fair ML methods, such as those found in the
counterfactual fairness literature on the one hand, and, on the other,
measurement models found in the statistical literature. We discuss these
approaches and their connection resulting in our framework. In a healthcare
decision problem, we find that using a latent variable model to account for
measurement error removes the unfairness detected previously.

    <title>A Path to Simpler Models Starts With Noise</title>
    <summary>  The Rashomon set is the set of models that perform approximately equally well
on a given dataset, and the Rashomon ratio is the fraction of all models in a
given hypothesis space that are in the Rashomon set. Rashomon ratios are often
large for tabular datasets in criminal justice, healthcare, lending, education,
and in other areas, which has practical implications about whether simpler
models can attain the same level of accuracy as more complex models. An open
question is why Rashomon ratios often tend to be large. In this work, we
propose and study a mechanism of the data generation process, coupled with
choices usually made by the analyst during the learning process, that
determines the size of the Rashomon ratio. Specifically, we demonstrate that
noisier datasets lead to larger Rashomon ratios through the way that
practitioners train models. Additionally, we introduce a measure called pattern
diversity, which captures the average difference in predictions between
distinct classification patterns in the Rashomon set, and motivate why it tends
to increase with label noise. Our results explain a key aspect of why simpler
models often tend to perform as well as black box models on complex, noisier
datasets.

    <title>An Adaptive Simulated Annealing-Based Machine Learning Approach for
  Developing an E-Triage Tool for Hospital Emergency Operations</title>
    <summary>  Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

    <title>Adherence Forecasting for Guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral
  Therapy: A Minimally Data-Sensitive Approach</title>
    <summary>  Internet-delivered psychological treatments (IDPT) are seen as an effective
and scalable pathway to improving the accessibility of mental healthcare.
Within this context, treatment adherence is an especially pertinent challenge
to address due to the reduced interaction between healthcare professionals and
patients. In parallel, the increase in regulations surrounding the use of
personal data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), makes
data minimization a core consideration for real-world implementation of IDPTs.
Consequently, this work proposes a Self-Attention-based deep learning approach
to perform automatic adherence forecasting, while only relying on minimally
sensitive login/logout-timestamp data. This approach was tested on a dataset
containing 342 patients undergoing Guided Internet-delivered Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (G-ICBT) treatment. Of these 342 patients, 101 (~30%) were
considered non-adherent (dropout) based on the adherence definition used in
this work (i.e. at least eight connections to the platform lasting more than a
minute over 56 days). The proposed model achieved over 70% average balanced
accuracy, after only 20 out of the 56 days (~1/3) of the treatment had elapsed.
This study demonstrates that automatic adherence forecasting for G-ICBT, is
achievable using only minimally sensitive data, thus facilitating the
implementation of such tools within real-world IDPT platforms.

    <title>Quantifying the Suicidal Tendency on Social Media: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Amid lockdown period more people express their feelings over social media
platforms due to closed third-place and academic researchers have witnessed
strong associations between the mental healthcare and social media posts. The
stress for a brief period may lead to clinical depressions and the long-lasting
traits of prevailing depressions can be life threatening with suicidal ideation
as the possible outcome. The increasing concern towards the rise in number of
suicide cases is because it is one of the leading cause of premature but
preventable death. Recent studies have shown that mining social media data has
helped in quantifying the suicidal tendency of users at risk. This potential
manuscript elucidates the taxonomy of mental healthcare and highlights some
recent attempts in examining the potential of quantifying suicidal tendency on

    <title>Looking deeper into interpretable deep learning in neuroimaging: a
  comprehensive survey</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) models have been popular due to their ability to learn
directly from the raw data in an end-to-end paradigm, alleviating the concern
of a separate error-prone feature extraction phase. Recent DL-based
neuroimaging studies have also witnessed a noticeable performance advancement
over traditional machine learning algorithms. But the challenges of deep
learning models still exist because of the lack of transparency in these models
for their successful deployment in real-world applications. In recent years,
Explainable AI (XAI) has undergone a surge of developments mainly to get
intuitions of how the models reached the decisions, which is essential for
safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law enforcement
agencies. While the interpretability domain is advancing noticeably,
researchers are still unclear about what aspect of model learning a post hoc
method reveals and how to validate its reliability. This paper comprehensively
reviews interpretable deep learning models in the neuroimaging domain. Firstly,
we summarize the current status of interpretability resources in general,
focusing on the progression of methods, associated challenges, and opinions.
Secondly, we discuss how multiple recent neuroimaging studies leveraged model
interpretability to capture anatomical and functional brain alterations most
relevant to model predictions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the
current practices and offer some valuable insights and guidance on how we can
steer our future research directions to make deep learning models substantially
interpretable and thus advance scientific understanding of brain disorders.

    <title>Internet of Things Technologies for Managing COVID-19 Pandemic:
  Recommendations and Proposed Framework</title>
    <summary>  The Internet of Things, often known as IoT, is an innovative technology that
connects digital devices all around us, allowing Machine to Machine (M2M)
communication between digital devices all over the world. Due to the
convenience, connectivity, and affordability, this IoT is being served in
various domains including healthcare where it brings exceptional benefits to
improve patient care, uplifting medical resources to the next level. Some of
these examples include surveillance networks, healthcare delivery technologies,
and smart thermal detection. As of now, the IoT is served in various aspects of
healthcare making many of the medical processes much easier as opposed to the
earlier times. One of the most important aspects that this IoT can be used is,
managing various aspects of healthcare during global pandemics, as pandemics
can bring an immense strain on healthcare resources, during the pandemic. As
there is no proper study is done with regards to the proper use of IoT for
managing pandemics, in this regard, through our study we aim to review various
use cases of IoT towards managing pandemics especially in terms of COVID-19;
owing to what we are currently going through. In this regard, we are proposing
a conceptual framework synthesizing the current literature and resources, which
can be adopted when managing global pandemics to accelerate the battle pace
with these deadly pandemics and focusing on what the entire world is currently
going through where almost more than four (04) million people are diminished of
this COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Teaching Meaningful Explanations</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of machine learning in high-stakes applications such as
healthcare and law has lagged in part because predictions are not accompanied
by explanations comprehensible to the domain user, who often holds the ultimate
responsibility for decisions and outcomes. In this paper, we propose an
approach to generate such explanations in which training data is augmented to
include, in addition to features and labels, explanations elicited from domain
users. A joint model is then learned to produce both labels and explanations
from the input features. This simple idea ensures that explanations are
tailored to the complexity expectations and domain knowledge of the consumer.
Evaluation spans multiple modeling techniques on a game dataset, a (visual)
aesthetics dataset, a chemical odor dataset and a Melanoma dataset showing that
our approach is generalizable across domains and algorithms. Results
demonstrate that meaningful explanations can be reliably taught to machine
learning algorithms, and in some cases, also improve modeling accuracy.

    <title>Leveraging Clinical Time-Series Data for Prediction: A Cautionary Tale</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare, patient risk stratification models are often learned using
time-series data extracted from electronic health records. When extracting data
for a clinical prediction task, several formulations exist, depending on how
one chooses the time of prediction and the prediction horizon. In this paper,
we show how the formulation can greatly impact both model performance and
clinical utility. Leveraging a publicly available ICU dataset, we consider two
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality, and hypokalemia. Through
these case studies, we demonstrate the necessity of evaluating models using an
outcome-independent reference point, since choosing the time of prediction
relative to the event can result in unrealistic performance. Further, an
outcome-independent scheme outperforms an outcome-dependent scheme on both
tasks (In-Hospital Mortality AUROC .882 vs. .831; Serum Potassium: AUROC .829
vs. .740) when evaluated on test sets that mimic real-world use.

    <title>Weakly-supervised Multi-output Regression via Correlated Gaussian
  Processes</title>
    <summary>  Multi-output regression seeks to borrow strength and leverage commonalities
across different but related outputs in order to enhance learning and
prediction accuracy. A fundamental assumption is that the output/group
membership labels for all observations are known. This assumption is often
violated in real applications. For instance, in healthcare datasets, sensitive
attributes such as ethnicity are often missing or unreported. To this end, we
introduce a weakly-supervised multi-output model based on dependent Gaussian
processes. Our approach is able to leverage data without complete group labels
or possibly only prior belief on group memberships to enhance accuracy across
all outputs. Through intensive simulations and case studies on an Insulin,
Testosterone and Bodyfat dataset, we show that our model excels in multi-output
settings with missing labels, while being competitive in traditional fully
labeled settings. We end by highlighting the possible use of our approach in
fair inference and sequential decision-making.

    <title>Early Anomaly Detection in Time Series: A Hierarchical Approach for
  Predicting Critical Health Episodes</title>
    <summary>  The early detection of anomalous events in time series data is essential in
many domains of application. In this paper we deal with critical health events,
which represent a significant cause of mortality in intensive care units of
hospitals. The timely prediction of these events is crucial for mitigating
their consequences and improving healthcare. One of the most common approaches
to tackle early anomaly detection problems is standard classification methods.
In this paper we propose a novel method that uses a layered learning
architecture to address these tasks. One key contribution of our work is the
idea of pre-conditional events, which denote arbitrary but computable relaxed
versions of the event of interest. We leverage this idea to break the original
problem into two hierarchical layers, which we hypothesize are easier to solve.
The results suggest that the proposed approach leads to a better performance
relative to state of the art approaches for critical health episode prediction.

    <title>An Interpretable Framework for Drug-Target Interaction with Gated Cross
  Attention</title>
    <summary>  In silico prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is significant for
drug discovery because it can largely reduce timelines and costs in the drug
development process. Specifically, deep learning-based DTI approaches have been
shown promising results in terms of accuracy and low cost for the prediction.
However, they pay little attention to the interpretability of their prediction
results and feature-level interactions between a drug and a target. In this
study, we propose a novel interpretable framework that can provide reasonable
cues for the interaction sites. To this end, we elaborately design a gated
cross-attention mechanism that crossly attends drug and target features by
constructing explicit interactions between these features. The gating function
in the method enables neural models to focus on salient regions over entire
sequences of drugs and proteins, and the byproduct from the function, which is
the attention map, could serve as interpretable factors. The experimental
results show the efficacy of the proposed method in two DTI datasets.
Additionally, we show that gated cross-attention can sensitively react to the
mutation, and this result could provide insights into the identification of
novel drugs targeting mutant proteins.

    <title>CheXplaining in Style: Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-rays
  using StyleGAN</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models used in medical image analysis are prone to raising
reliability concerns due to their black-box nature. To shed light on these
black-box models, previous works predominantly focus on identifying the
contribution of input features to the diagnosis, i.e., feature attribution. In
this work, we explore counterfactual explanations to identify what patterns the
models rely on for diagnosis. Specifically, we investigate the effect of
changing features within chest X-rays on the classifier's output to understand
its decision mechanism. We leverage a StyleGAN-based approach (StyleEx) to
create counterfactual explanations for chest X-rays by manipulating specific
latent directions in their latent space. In addition, we propose EigenFind to
significantly reduce the computation time of generated explanations. We
clinically evaluate the relevancy of our counterfactual explanations with the
help of radiologists. Our code is publicly available.

    <title>Language Models are Few-shot Learners for Prognostic Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Clinical prediction is an essential task in the healthcare industry. However,
the recent success of transformers, on which large language models are built,
has not been extended to this domain. In this research, we explore the use of
transformers and language models in prognostic prediction for immunotherapy
using real-world patients' clinical data and molecular profiles. This paper
investigates the potential of transformers to improve clinical prediction
compared to conventional machine learning approaches and addresses the
challenge of few-shot learning in predicting rare disease areas. The study
benchmarks the efficacy of baselines and language models on prognostic
prediction across multiple cancer types and investigates the impact of
different pretrained language models under few-shot regimes. The results
demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and highlight the potential of
NLP in clinical research to improve early detection and intervention for
different diseases.

    <title>Applications of Voice User Interfaces in Clinical Settings</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of modern technologies for use in healthcare has become an
inevitable change. The emergence of artificial intelligence drives this digital
disruption. Artificial intelligence has augmented machine capabilities to act
like and interact with human beings. As the healthcare industry adopts
technology in most areas, an area in healthcare that is touched by this change
is clinical practice. New technologies are being designed to improve healthcare
services. One aspect of these technologies is voice user interfaces. This paper
reviews applications of voice user interfaces in clinical settings. Several
information sources were consulted, and based on eligibility criteria, a search
was conducted, and ten papers selected. This study presents findings from the
last ten years (2009-2019). The results are categorized based on findings, also
they contribute to the discussion and the research gaps identified for future
study as regards context-aware voice user interfaces and the appearance of
conversational agents from a given set of options.

    <title>An Interpretable Deep Learning System for Automatically Scoring Request
  for Proposals</title>
    <summary>  The Managed Care system within Medicaid (US Healthcare) uses Request For
Proposals (RFP) to award contracts for various healthcare and related services.
RFP responses are very detailed documents (hundreds of pages) submitted by
competing organisations to win contracts. Subject matter expertise and domain
knowledge play an important role in preparing RFP responses along with analysis
of historical submissions. Automated analysis of these responses through
Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems can reduce time and effort needed to
explore historical responses, and assisting in writing better responses. Our
work draws parallels between scoring RFPs and essay scoring models, while
highlighting new challenges and the need for interpretability. Typical scoring
models focus on word level impacts to grade essays and other short write-ups.
We propose a novel Bi-LSTM based regression model, and provide deeper insight
into phrases which latently impact scoring of responses. We contend the merits
of our proposed methodology using extensive quantitative experiments. We also
qualitatively asses the impact of important phrases using human evaluators.
Finally, we introduce a novel problem statement that can be used to further
improve the state of the art in NLP based automatic scoring systems.

    <title>An Efficient Approach for Optimizing the Cost-effective Individualized
  Treatment Rule Using Conditional Random Forest</title>
    <summary>  Evidence from observational studies has become increasingly important for
supporting healthcare policy making via cost-effectiveness (CE) analyses.
Similar as in comparative effectiveness studies, health economic evaluations
that consider subject-level heterogeneity produce individualized treatment
rules (ITRs) that are often more cost-effective than one-size-fits-all
treatment. Thus, it is of great interest to develop statistical tools for
learning such a cost-effective ITR (CE-ITR) under the causal inference
framework that allows proper handling of potential confounding and can be
applied to both trials and observational studies. In this paper, we use the
concept of net-monetary-benefit (NMB) to assess the trade-off between health
benefits and related costs. We estimate CE-ITR as a function of patients'
characteristics that, when implemented, optimizes the allocation of limited
healthcare resources by maximizing health gains while minimizing
treatment-related costs. We employ the conditional random forest approach and
identify the optimal CE-ITR using NMB-based classification algorithms, where
two partitioned estimators are proposed for the subject-specific weights to
effectively incorporate information from censored individuals. We conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposals. We apply our
top-performing algorithm to the NIH-funded Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention
Trial (SPRINT) to illustrate the CE gains of assigning customized intensive
blood pressure therapy.

    <title>A Survey on Vertical Federated Learning: From a Layered Perspective</title>
    <summary>  Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising category of federated
learning for the scenario where data is vertically partitioned and distributed
among parties. VFL enriches the description of samples using features from
different parties to improve model capacity. Compared with horizontal federated
learning, in most cases, VFL is applied in the commercial cooperation scenario
of companies. Therefore, VFL contains tremendous business values. In the past
few years, VFL has attracted more and more attention in both academia and
industry. In this paper, we systematically investigate the current work of VFL
from a layered perspective. From the hardware layer to the vertical federated
system layer, researchers contribute to various aspects of VFL. Moreover, the
application of VFL has covered a wide range of areas, e.g., finance,
healthcare, etc. At each layer, we categorize the existing work and explore the
challenges for the convenience of further research and development of VFL.
Especially, we design a novel MOSP tree taxonomy to analyze the core component
of VFL, i.e., secure vertical federated machine learning algorithm. Our
taxonomy considers four dimensions, i.e., machine learning model (M),
protection object (O), security model (S), and privacy-preserving protocol (P),
and provides a comprehensive investigation.

    <title>ECG Heartbeat classification using deep transfer learning with
  Convolutional Neural Network and STFT technique</title>
    <summary>  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple non-invasive measure to identify
heart-related issues such as irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias. While
artificial intelligence and machine learning is being utilized in a wide range
of healthcare related applications and datasets, many arrhythmia classifiers
using deep learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, sizes
of the available datasets from which to build and assess machine learning
models is often very small and the lack of well-annotated public ECG datasets
is evident. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework that
is aimed to perform classification on a small size training dataset. The
proposed method is to fine-tune a general-purpose image classifier ResNet-18
with MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset in accordance with the AAMI EC57 standard. This
paper further investigates many existing deep learning models that have failed
to avoid data leakage against AAMI recommendations. We compare how different
data split methods impact the model performance. This comparison study implies
that future work in arrhythmia classification should follow the AAMI EC57
standard when using any including MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset.

    <title>Privacy Preserving Machine Learning for Electronic Health Records using
  Federated Learning and Differential Privacy</title>
    <summary>  An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an electronic database used by
healthcare providers to store patients' medical records which may include
diagnoses, treatments, costs, and other personal information. Machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to extract and analyze patient data to improve
patient care. Patient records contain highly sensitive information, such as
social security numbers (SSNs) and residential addresses, which introduces a
need to apply privacy-preserving techniques for these ML models using federated
learning and differential privacy.

    <title>MUSBO: Model-based Uncertainty Regularized and Sample Efficient Batch
  Optimization for Deployment Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  In many contemporary applications such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and
recommendation systems, continuous deployment of new policies for data
collection and online learning is either cost ineffective or impractical. We
consider a setting that lies between pure offline reinforcement learning (RL)
and pure online RL called deployment constrained RL in which the number of
policy deployments for data sampling is limited. To solve this challenging
task, we propose a new algorithmic learning framework called Model-based
Uncertainty regularized and Sample Efficient Batch Optimization (MUSBO). Our
framework discovers novel and high quality samples for each deployment to
enable efficient data collection. During each offline training session, we
bootstrap the policy update by quantifying the amount of uncertainty within our
collected data. In the high support region (low uncertainty), we encourage our
policy by taking an aggressive update. In the low support region (high
uncertainty) when the policy bootstraps into the out-of-distribution region, we
downweight it by our estimated uncertainty quantification. Experimental results
show that MUSBO achieves state-of-the-art performance in the deployment
constrained RL setting.

    <title>A Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Human Activity Recognition on Edge
  Devices</title>
    <summary>  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable and mobile sensors has gained
momentum in last few years, in various fields, such as, healthcare,
surveillance, education, entertainment. Nowadays, Edge Computing has emerged to
reduce communication latency and network traffic.Edge devices are resource
constrained devices and cannot support high computation. In literature, various
models have been developed for HAR. In recent years, deep learning algorithms
have shown high performance in HAR, but these algorithms require lot of
computation making them inefficient to be deployed on edge devices. This paper,
proposes a Lightweight Deep Learning Model for HAR requiring less computational
power, making it suitable to be deployed on edge devices. The performance of
proposed model is tested on the participants six daily activities data. Results
show that the proposed model outperforms many of the existing machine learning
and deep learning techniques.

    <title>Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection</title>
    <summary>  Anomaly detection is one of the most active research areas in various
critical domains, such as healthcare, fintech, and public security. However,
little attention has been paid to scholarly data, i.e., anomaly detection in a
citation network. Citation is considered as one of the most crucial metrics to
evaluate the impact of scientific research, which may be gamed in multiple
ways. Therefore, anomaly detection in citation networks is of significant
importance to identify manipulation and inflation of citations. To address this
open issue, we propose a novel deep graph learning model, namely GLAD (Graph
Learning for Anomaly Detection), to identify anomalies in citation networks.
GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by
adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks. It
exploits not only the relevance of citation contents but also hidden
relationships between papers. Within the GLAD framework, we propose an
algorithm called CPU (Citation PUrpose) to discover the purpose of citation
based on citation texts. The performance of GLAD is validated through a
simulated anomalous citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of GLAD on the anomalous citation detection task.

    <title>DeepTechnome: Mitigating Unknown Bias in Deep Learning Based Assessment
  of CT Images</title>
    <summary>  Reliably detecting diseases using relevant biological information is crucial
for real-world applicability of deep learning techniques in medical imaging. We
debias deep learning models during training against unknown bias - without
preprocessing/filtering the input beforehand or assuming specific knowledge
about its distribution or precise nature in the dataset. We use control regions
as surrogates that carry information regarding the bias, employ the classifier
model to extract features, and suppress biased intermediate features with our
custom, modular DecorreLayer. We evaluate our method on a dataset of 952 lung
computed tomography scans by introducing simulated biases w.r.t. reconstruction
kernel and noise level and propose including an adversarial test set in
evaluations of bias reduction techniques. In a moderately sized model
architecture, applying the proposed method to learn from data exhibiting a
strong bias, it near-perfectly recovers the classification performance observed
when training with corresponding unbiased data.

    <title>DySurv: Dynamic Deep Learning Model for Survival Prediction in the ICU</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis focuses on estimating time-to-event distributions which can
help in dynamic risk prediction in healthcare. Extending beyond the classical
Cox model, deep learning techniques have been developed which moved away from
the constraining assumptions of proportional hazards. Traditional statistical
models often only include static information where, in this work, we propose a
novel conditional variational autoencoder-based method called DySurv, which
uses a combination of static and time-series measurements from patient
electronic health records to estimate the risk of death dynamically. DySurv has
been tested on several time-to-event benchmarks where it outperforms existing
methods, including deep learning methods, and we evaluate it on real-world
intensive care unit data from MIMIC-IV and eICU. The predictive capacity of
DySurv is consistent and the survival estimates remain disentangled across
different datasets supporting the idea that dynamic deep learning models based
on conditional variational inference in multi-task cases can be robust models
for survival analysis.

    <title>Symbolic Learning for Material Discovery</title>
    <summary>  Discovering new materials is essential to solve challenges in climate change,
sustainability and healthcare. A typical task in materials discovery is to
search for a material in a database which maximises the value of a function.
That function is often expensive to evaluate, and can rely upon a simulation or
an experiment. Here, we introduce SyMDis, a sample efficient optimisation
method based on symbolic learning, that discovers near-optimal materials in a
large database. SyMDis performs comparably to a state-of-the-art optimiser,
whilst learning interpretable rules to aid physical and chemical verification.
Furthermore, the rules learned by SyMDis generalise to unseen datasets and
return high performing candidates in a zero-shot evaluation, which is difficult
to achieve with other approaches.

    <title>A Fully-Automated Pipeline for Detection and Segmentation of Liver
  Lesions and Pathological Lymph Nodes</title>
    <summary>  We propose a fully-automated method for accurate and robust detection and
segmentation of potentially cancerous lesions found in the liver and in lymph
nodes. The process is performed in three steps, including organ detection,
lesion detection and lesion segmentation. Our method applies machine learning
techniques such as marginal space learning and convolutional neural networks,
as well as active contour models. The method proves to be robust in its
handling of extremely high lesion diversity. We tested our method on volumetric
computed tomography (CT) images, including 42 volumes containing liver lesions
and 86 volumes containing 595 pathological lymph nodes. Preliminary results
under 10-fold cross validation show that for both the liver lesions and the
lymph nodes, a total detection sensitivity of 0.53 and average Dice score of
$0.71 \pm 0.15$ for segmentation were obtained.

    <title>Privacy-preserving medical image analysis</title>
    <summary>  The utilisation of artificial intelligence in medicine and healthcare has led
to successful clinical applications in several domains. The conflict between
data usage and privacy protection requirements in such systems must be resolved
for optimal results as well as ethical and legal compliance. This calls for
innovative solutions such as privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). We
present PriMIA (Privacy-preserving Medical Image Analysis), a software
framework designed for PPML in medical imaging. In a real-life case study we
demonstrate significantly better classification performance of a securely
aggregated federated learning model compared to human experts on unseen
datasets. Furthermore, we show an inference-as-a-service scenario for
end-to-end encrypted diagnosis, where neither the data nor the model are
revealed. Lastly, we empirically evaluate the framework's security against a
gradient-based model inversion attack and demonstrate that no usable
information can be recovered from the model.

    <title>Massif: Interactive Interpretation of Adversarial Attacks on Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly powering high-stakes
applications such as autonomous cars and healthcare; however, DNNs are often
treated as "black boxes" in such applications. Recent research has also
revealed that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising
serious concerns over deploying DNNs in the real world. To overcome these
deficiencies, we are developing Massif, an interactive tool for deciphering
adversarial attacks. Massif identifies and interactively visualizes neurons and
their connections inside a DNN that are strongly activated or suppressed by an
adversarial attack. Massif provides both a high-level, interpretable overview
of the effect of an attack on a DNN, and a low-level, detailed description of
the affected neurons. These tightly coupled views in Massif help people better
understand which input features are most vulnerable or important for correct
predictions.

    <title>Learning Occupational Task-Shares Dynamics for the Future of Work</title>
    <summary>  The recent wave of AI and automation has been argued to differ from previous
General Purpose Technologies (GPTs), in that it may lead to rapid change in
occupations' underlying task requirements and persistent technological
unemployment. In this paper, we apply a novel methodology of dynamic task
shares to a large dataset of online job postings to explore how exactly
occupational task demands have changed over the past decade of AI innovation,
especially across high, mid and low wage occupations. Notably, big data and AI
have risen significantly among high wage occupations since 2012 and 2016,
respectively. We built an ARIMA model to predict future occupational task
demands and showcase several relevant examples in Healthcare, Administration,
and IT. Such task demands predictions across occupations will play a pivotal
role in retraining the workforce of the future.

    <title>Is it worth it? Comparing six deep and classical methods for
  unsupervised anomaly detection in time series</title>
    <summary>  Detecting anomalies in time series data is important in a variety of fields,
including system monitoring, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While the abundance
of available methods makes it difficult to choose the most appropriate method
for a given application, each method has its strengths in detecting certain
types of anomalies. In this study, we compare six unsupervised anomaly
detection methods of varying complexity to determine whether more complex
methods generally perform better and if certain methods are better suited to
certain types of anomalies. We evaluated the methods using the UCR anomaly
archive, a recent benchmark dataset for anomaly detection. We analyzed the
results on a dataset and anomaly type level after adjusting the necessary
hyperparameters for each method. Additionally, we assessed the ability of each
method to incorporate prior knowledge about anomalies and examined the
differences between point-wise and sequence-wise features. Our experiments show
that classical machine learning methods generally outperform deep learning
methods across a range of anomaly types.

    <title>RED CoMETS: An ensemble classifier for symbolically represented
  multivariate time series</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time series classification is a rapidly growing research field
with practical applications in finance, healthcare, engineering, and more. The
complexity of classifying multivariate time series data arises from its high
dimensionality, temporal dependencies, and varying lengths. This paper
introduces a novel ensemble classifier called RED CoMETS (Random Enhanced
Co-eye for Multivariate Time Series), which addresses these challenges. RED
CoMETS builds upon the success of Co-eye, an ensemble classifier specifically
designed for symbolically represented univariate time series, and extends its
capabilities to handle multivariate data. The performance of RED CoMETS is
evaluated on benchmark datasets from the UCR archive, where it demonstrates
competitive accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art techniques in
multivariate settings. Notably, it achieves the highest reported accuracy in
the literature for the 'HandMovementDirection' dataset. Moreover, the proposed
method significantly reduces computation time compared to Co-eye, making it an
efficient and effective choice for multivariate time series classification.

    <title>Explain To Decide: A Human-Centric Review on the Role of Explainable
  Artificial Intelligence in AI-assisted Decision Making</title>
    <summary>  The unprecedented performance of machine learning models in recent years,
particularly Deep Learning and transformer models, has resulted in their
application in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and education.
However, the models are error-prone and cannot be used autonomously, especially
in decision-making scenarios where, technically or ethically, the cost of error
is high. Moreover, because of the black-box nature of these models, it is
frequently difficult for the end user to comprehend the models' outcomes and
underlying processes to trust and use the model outcome to make a decision.
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aids end-user understanding of the
model by utilizing approaches, including visualization techniques, to explain
and interpret the inner workings of the model and how it arrives at a result.
Although numerous research studies have been conducted recently focusing on the
performance of models and the XAI approaches, less work has been done on the
impact of explanations on human-AI team performance. This paper surveyed the
recent empirical studies on XAI's impact on human-AI decision-making,
identified the challenges, and proposed future research directions.

    <title>False Discovery Rate Control for Gaussian Graphical Models via
  Neighborhood Screening</title>
    <summary>  Gaussian graphical models emerge in a wide range of fields. They model the
statistical relationships between variables as a graph, where an edge between
two variables indicates conditional dependence. Unfortunately, well-established
estimators, such as the graphical lasso or neighborhood selection, are known to
be susceptible to a high prevalence of false edge detections. False detections
may encourage inaccurate or even incorrect scientific interpretations, with
major implications in applications, such as biomedicine or healthcare. In this
paper, we introduce a nodewise variable selection approach to graph learning
and provably control the false discovery rate of the selected edge set at a
self-estimated level. A novel fusion method of the individual neighborhoods
outputs an undirected graph estimate. The proposed method is parameter-free and
does not require tuning by the user. Benchmarks against competing false
discovery rate controlling methods in numerical experiments considering
different graph topologies show a significant gain in performance.

    <title>IntelligentPooling: Practical Thompson Sampling for mHealth</title>
    <summary>  In mobile health (mHealth) smart devices deliver behavioral treatments
repeatedly over time to a user with the goal of helping the user adopt and
maintain healthy behaviors. Reinforcement learning appears ideal for learning
how to optimally make these sequential treatment decisions. However,
significant challenges must be overcome before reinforcement learning can be
effectively deployed in a mobile healthcare setting. In this work we are
concerned with the following challenges: 1) individuals who are in the same
context can exhibit differential response to treatments 2) only a limited
amount of data is available for learning on any one individual, and 3)
non-stationary responses to treatment. To address these challenges we
generalize Thompson-Sampling bandit algorithms to develop IntelligentPooling.
IntelligentPooling learns personalized treatment policies thus addressing
challenge one. To address the second challenge, IntelligentPooling updates each
user's degree of personalization while making use of available data on other
users to speed up learning. Lastly, IntelligentPooling allows responsivity to
vary as a function of a user's time since beginning treatment, thus addressing
challenge three. We show that IntelligentPooling achieves an average of 26%
lower regret than state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the promise of this approach
and its ability to learn from even a small group of users in a live clinical
trial.

    <title>Causal Rule Learning: Enhancing the Understanding of Heterogeneous
  Treatment Effect via Weighted Causal Rules</title>
    <summary>  Interpretability is a key concern in estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects using machine learning methods, especially for healthcare applications
where high-stake decisions are often made. Inspired by the Predictive,
Descriptive, Relevant framework of interpretability, we propose causal rule
learning which finds a refined set of causal rules characterizing potential
subgroups to estimate and enhance our understanding of heterogeneous treatment
effects. Causal rule learning involves three phases: rule discovery, rule
selection, and rule analysis. In the rule discovery phase, we utilize a causal
forest to generate a pool of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average
treatment effects. The selection phase then employs a D-learning method to
select a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment
effects as a linear combination of the subgroup-level effects. This helps to
answer an ignored question by previous literature: what if an individual
simultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment
effects? The rule analysis phase outlines a detailed procedure to further
analyze each rule in the subset from multiple perspectives, revealing the most
promising rules for further validation. The rules themselves, their
corresponding subgroup treatment effects, and their weights in the linear
combination give us more insights into heterogeneous treatment effects.
Simulation and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superior performance of
causal rule learning on the interpretable estimation of heterogeneous treatment
effect when the ground truth is complex and the sample size is sufficient.

    <title>Dipole: Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare via Attention-based
  Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Predicting the future health information of patients from the historical
Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a core research task in the development of
personalized healthcare. Patient EHR data consist of sequences of visits over
time, where each visit contains multiple medical codes, including diagnosis,
medication, and procedure codes. The most important challenges for this task
are to model the temporality and high dimensionality of sequential EHR data and
to interpret the prediction results. Existing work solves this problem by
employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and utilizing
simple attention mechanism to interpret the results. However, RNN-based
approaches suffer from the problem that the performance of RNNs drops when the
length of sequences is large, and the relationships between subsequent visits
are ignored by current RNN-based approaches. To address these issues, we
propose {\sf Dipole}, an end-to-end, simple and robust model for predicting
patients' future health information. Dipole employs bidirectional recurrent
neural networks to remember all the information of both the past visits and the
future visits, and it introduces three attention mechanisms to measure the
relationships of different visits for the prediction. With the attention
mechanisms, Dipole can interpret the prediction results effectively. Dipole
also allows us to interpret the learned medical code representations which are
confirmed positively by medical experts. Experimental results on two real world
EHR datasets show that the proposed Dipole can significantly improve the
prediction accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction
approaches and provide clinically meaningful interpretation.

    <title>Monitoring Shortcut Learning using Mutual Information</title>
    <summary>  The failure of deep neural networks to generalize to out-of-distribution data
is a well-known problem and raises concerns about the deployment of trained
networks in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance and autonomous
vehicles. We study a particular kind of distribution shift $\unicode{x2013}$
shortcuts or spurious correlations in the training data. Shortcut learning is
often only exposed when models are evaluated on real-world data that does not
contain the same spurious correlations, posing a serious dilemma for AI
practitioners to properly assess the effectiveness of a trained model for
real-world applications. In this work, we propose to use the mutual information
(MI) between the learned representation and the input as a metric to find where
in training, the network latches onto shortcuts. Experiments demonstrate that
MI can be used as a domain-agnostic metric for monitoring shortcut learning.

    <title>Semi-supervised Cooperative Learning for Multiomics Data Fusion</title>
    <summary>  Multiomics data fusion integrates diverse data modalities, ranging from
transcriptomics to proteomics, to gain a comprehensive understanding of
biological systems and enhance predictions on outcomes of interest related to
disease phenotypes and treatment responses. Cooperative learning, a recently
proposed method, unifies the commonly-used fusion approaches, including early
and late fusion, and offers a systematic framework for leveraging the shared
underlying relationships across omics to strengthen signals. However, the
challenge of acquiring large-scale labeled data remains, and there are cases
where multiomics data are available but in the absence of annotated labels. To
harness the potential of unlabeled multiomcis data, we introduce
semi-supervised cooperative learning. By utilizing an "agreement penalty", our
method incorporates the additional unlabeled data in the learning process and
achieves consistently superior predictive performance on simulated data and a
real multiomics study of aging. It offers an effective solution to multiomics
data fusion in settings with both labeled and unlabeled data and maximizes the
utility of available data resources, with the potential of significantly
improving predictive models for diagnostics and therapeutics in an increasingly
multiomics world.

    <title>Towards Personalized Modeling of the Female Hormonal Cycle: Experiments
  with Mechanistic Models and Gaussian Processes</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we introduce a novel task for machine learning in healthcare,
namely personalized modeling of the female hormonal cycle. The motivation for
this work is to model the hormonal cycle and predict its phases in time, both
for healthy individuals and for those with disorders of the reproductive
system. Because there are individual differences in the menstrual cycle, we are
particularly interested in personalized models that can account for individual
idiosyncracies, towards identifying phenotypes of menstrual cycles. As a first
step, we consider the hormonal cycle as a set of observations through time. We
use a previously validated mechanistic model to generate realistic hormonal
patterns, and experiment with Gaussian process regression to estimate their
values over time. Specifically, we are interested in the feasibility of
predicting menstrual cycle phases under varying learning conditions: number of
cycles used for training, hormonal measurement noise and sampling rates, and
informed vs. agnostic sampling of hormonal measurements. Our results indicate
that Gaussian processes can help model the female menstrual cycle. We discuss
the implications of our experiments in the context of modeling the female
menstrual cycle.

    <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for Early Autism Detection via INDT-ASD
  Indian Database</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) has advanced quickly, particularly throughout the area
of health care. The diagnosis of neurodevelopment problems using ML is a very
important area of healthcare. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the
developmental disorders that is growing the fastest globally. The clinical
screening tests used to identify autistic symptoms are expensive and
time-consuming. But now that ML has been advanced, it's feasible to identify
autism early on. Previously, many different techniques have been used in
investigations. Still, none of them have produced the anticipated outcomes when
it comes to the capacity to predict autistic features utilizing a clinically
validated Indian ASD database. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simple,
quick, and inexpensive technique for identifying ASD by using ML. Various
machine learning classifiers, including Adaboost (AB), Gradient Boost (GB),
Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gaussian
Naive Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM),
were used to develop the autism prediction model. The proposed method was
tested with records from the AIIMS Modified INDT-ASD (AMI) database, which were
collected through an application developed by AIIMS in Delhi, India. Feature
engineering has been applied to make the proposed solution easier than already
available solutions. Using the proposed model, we succeeded in predicting ASD
using a minimized set of 20 questions rather than the 28 questions presented in
AMI with promising accuracy. In a comparative evaluation, SVM emerged as the
superior model among others, with 100 $\pm$ 0.05\% accuracy, higher recall by
5.34\%, and improved accuracy by 2.22\%-6.67\% over RF. We have also introduced
a web-based solution supporting both Hindi and English.

    <title>Towards Structuring Real-World Data at Scale: Deep Learning for
  Extracting Key Oncology Information from Clinical Text with Patient-Level
  Supervision</title>
    <summary>  Objective: The majority of detailed patient information in real-world data
(RWD) is only consistently available in free-text clinical documents. Manual
curation is expensive and time-consuming. Developing natural language
processing (NLP) methods for structuring RWD is thus essential for scaling
real-world evidence generation.
  Materials and Methods: Traditional rule-based systems are vulnerable to the
prevalent linguistic variations and ambiguities in clinical text, and prior
applications of machine-learning methods typically require sentence-level or
report-level labeled examples that are hard to produce at scale. We propose
leveraging patient-level supervision from medical registries, which are often
readily available and capture key patient information, for general RWD
applications. To combat the lack of sentence-level or report-level annotations,
we explore advanced deep-learning methods by combining domain-specific
pretraining, recurrent neural networks, and hierarchical attention.
  Results: We conduct an extensive study on 135,107 patients from the cancer
registry of a large integrated delivery network (IDN) comprising healthcare
systems in five western US states. Our deep learning methods attain test AUROC
of 94-99% for key tumor attributes and comparable performance on held-out data
from separate health systems and states.
  Discussion and Conclusion: Ablation results demonstrate clear superiority of
these advanced deep-learning methods over prior approaches. Error analysis
shows that our NLP system sometimes even corrects errors in registrar labels.
We also conduct a preliminary investigation in accelerating registry curation
and general RWD structuring via assisted curation for over 1.2 million cancer
patients in this healthcare network.

    <title>A Block Coordinate Ascent Algorithm for Mean-Variance Optimization</title>
    <summary>  Risk management in dynamic decision problems is a primary concern in many
fields, including financial investment, autonomous driving, and healthcare. The
mean-variance function is one of the most widely used objective functions in
risk management due to its simplicity and interpretability. Existing algorithms
for mean-variance optimization are based on multi-time-scale stochastic
approximation, whose learning rate schedules are often hard to tune, and have
only asymptotic convergence proof. In this paper, we develop a model-free
policy search framework for mean-variance optimization with finite-sample error
bound analysis (to local optima). Our starting point is a reformulation of the
original mean-variance function with its Fenchel dual, from which we propose a
stochastic block coordinate ascent policy search algorithm. Both the asymptotic
convergence guarantee of the last iteration's solution and the convergence rate
of the randomly picked solution are provided, and their applicability is
demonstrated on several benchmark domains.

    <title>Personalized Survival Prediction with Contextual Explanation Networks</title>
    <summary>  Accurate and transparent prediction of cancer survival times on the level of
individual patients can inform and improve patient care and treatment
practices. In this paper, we design a model that concurrently learns to
accurately predict patient-specific survival distributions and to explain its
predictions in terms of patient attributes such as clinical tests or
assessments. Our model is flexible and based on a recurrent network, can handle
various modalities of data including temporal measurements, and yet constructs
and uses simple explanations in the form of patient- and time-specific linear
regression. For analysis, we use two publicly available datasets and show that
our networks outperform a number of baselines in prediction while providing a
way to inspect the reasons behind each prediction.

    <title>Syfer: Neural Obfuscation for Private Data Release</title>
    <summary>  Balancing privacy and predictive utility remains a central challenge for
machine learning in healthcare. In this paper, we develop Syfer, a neural
obfuscation method to protect against re-identification attacks. Syfer composes
trained layers with random neural networks to encode the original data (e.g.
X-rays) while maintaining the ability to predict diagnoses from the encoded
data. The randomness in the encoder acts as the private key for the data owner.
We quantify privacy as the number of attacker guesses required to re-identify a
single image (guesswork). We propose a contrastive learning algorithm to
estimate guesswork. We show empirically that differentially private methods,
such as DP-Image, obtain privacy at a significant loss of utility. In contrast,
Syfer achieves strong privacy while preserving utility. For example, X-ray
classifiers built with DP-image, Syfer, and original data achieve average AUCs
of 0.53, 0.78, and 0.86, respectively.

    <title>Target-Focused Feature Selection Using a Bayesian Approach</title>
    <summary>  In many real-world scenarios where data is high dimensional, test time
acquisition of features is a non-trivial task due to costs associated with
feature acquisition and evaluating feature value. The need for highly confident
models with an extremely frugal acquisition of features can be addressed by
allowing a feature selection method to become target aware. We introduce an
approach to feature selection that is based on Bayesian learning, allowing us
to report target-specific levels of uncertainty, false positive, and false
negative rates. In addition, measuring uncertainty lifts the restriction on
feature selection being target agnostic, allowing for feature acquisition based
on a single target of focus out of many. We show that acquiring features for a
specific target is at least as good as common linear feature selection
approaches for small non-sparse datasets, and surpasses these when faced with
real-world healthcare data that is larger in scale and in sparseness.

    <title>Learning to Predict Error for MRI Reconstruction</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare applications, predictive uncertainty has been used to assess
predictive accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that predictive uncertainty
estimated by the current methods does not highly correlate with prediction
error by decomposing the latter into random and systematic errors, and showing
that the former is equivalent to the variance of the random error. In addition,
we observe that current methods unnecessarily compromise performance by
modifying the model and training loss to estimate the target and uncertainty
jointly. We show that estimating them separately without modifications improves
performance. Following this, we propose a novel method that estimates the
target labels and magnitude of the prediction error in two steps. We
demonstrate this method on a large-scale MRI reconstruction task, and achieve
significantly better results than the state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation
methods.

    <title>Deep learning for prediction of population health costs</title>
    <summary>  Accurate prediction of healthcare costs is important for optimally managing
health costs. However, methods leveraging the medical richness from data such
as health insurance claims or electronic health records are missing. Here, we
developed a deep neural network to predict future cost from health insurance
claims records. We applied the deep network and a ridge regression model to a
sample of 1.4 million German insurants to predict total one-year health care
costs. Both methods were compared to Morbi-RSA models with various performance
measures and were also used to predict patients with a change in costs and to
identify relevant codes for this prediction. We showed that the neural network
outperformed the ridge regression as well as all Morbi-RSA models for cost
prediction. Further, the neural network was superior to ridge regression in
predicting patients with cost change and identified more specific codes. In
summary, we showed that our deep neural network can leverage the full
complexity of the patient records and outperforms standard approaches. We
suggest that the better performance is due to the ability to incorporate
complex interactions in the model and that the model might also be used for
predicting other health phenotypes.

    <title>Black-box Off-policy Estimation for Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Off-policy estimation for long-horizon problems is important in many
real-life applications such as healthcare and robotics, where high-fidelity
simulators may not be available and on-policy evaluation is expensive or
impossible. Recently, \cite{liu18breaking} proposed an approach that avoids the
\emph{curse of horizon} suffered by typical importance-sampling-based methods.
While showing promising results, this approach is limited in practice as it
requires data be drawn from the \emph{stationary distribution} of a
\emph{known} behavior policy. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
eliminates such limitations. In particular, we formulate the problem as solving
for the fixed point of a certain operator. Using tools from Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), we develop a new estimator that computes importance
ratios of stationary distributions, without knowledge of how the off-policy
data are collected. We analyze its asymptotic consistency and finite-sample
generalization. Experiments on benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our
approach.

    <title>Differentially Private Estimation of Heterogeneous Causal Effects</title>
    <summary>  Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in domains such as healthcare or
social science often involves sensitive data where protecting privacy is
important. We introduce a general meta-algorithm for estimating conditional
average treatment effects (CATE) with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
meta-algorithm can work with simple, single-stage CATE estimators such as
S-learner and more complex multi-stage estimators such as DR and R-learner. We
perform a tight privacy analysis by taking advantage of sample splitting in our
meta-algorithm and the parallel composition property of differential privacy.
In this paper, we implement our approach using DP-EBMs as the base learner.
DP-EBMs are interpretable, high-accuracy models with privacy guarantees, which
allow us to directly observe the impact of DP noise on the learned causal
model. Our experiments show that multi-stage CATE estimators incur larger
accuracy loss than single-stage CATE or ATE estimators and that most of the
accuracy loss from differential privacy is due to an increase in variance, not
biased estimates of treatment effects.

    <title>SeFNet: Bridging Tabular Datasets with Semantic Feature Nets</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning applications cover a wide range of predictive tasks in which
tabular datasets play a significant role. However, although they often address
similar problems, tabular datasets are typically treated as standalone tasks.
The possibilities of using previously solved problems are limited due to the
lack of structured contextual information about their features and the lack of
understanding of the relations between them. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a new approach called Semantic Feature Net (SeFNet), capturing the
semantic meaning of the analyzed tabular features. By leveraging existing
ontologies and domain knowledge, SeFNet opens up new opportunities for sharing
insights between diverse predictive tasks. One such opportunity is the Dataset
Ontology-based Semantic Similarity (DOSS) measure, which quantifies the
similarity between datasets using relations across their features. In this
paper, we present an example of SeFNet prepared for a collection of predictive
tasks in healthcare, with the features' relations derived from the SNOMED-CT
ontology. The proposed SeFNet framework and the accompanying DOSS measure
address the issue of limited contextual information in tabular datasets. By
incorporating domain knowledge and establishing semantic relations between
features, we enhance the potential for meta-learning and enable valuable
insights to be shared across different predictive tasks.

    <title>Visual Explanation for Identification of the Brain Bases for Dyslexia on
  fMRI Data</title>
    <summary>  Brain imaging of mental health, neurodevelopmental and learning disorders has
coupled with machine learning to identify patients based only on their brain
activation, and ultimately identify features that generalize from smaller
samples of data to larger ones. However, the success of machine learning
classification algorithms on neurofunctional data has been limited to more
homogeneous data sets of dozens of participants. More recently, larger brain
imaging data sets have allowed for the application of deep learning techniques
to classify brain states and clinical groups solely from neurofunctional
features. Deep learning techniques provide helpful tools for classification in
healthcare applications, including classification of structural 3D brain
images. Recent approaches improved classification performance of larger
functional brain imaging data sets, but they fail to provide diagnostic
insights about the underlying conditions or provide an explanation from the
neural features that informed the classification. We address this challenge by
leveraging a number of network visualization techniques to show that, using
such techniques in convolutional neural network layers responsible for learning
high-level features, we are able to provide meaningful images for expert-backed
insights into the condition being classified. Our results show not only
accurate classification of developmental dyslexia from the brain imaging alone,
but also provide automatic visualizations of the features involved that match
contemporary neuroscientific knowledge, indicating that the visual explanations
do help in unveiling the neurological bases of the disorder being classified.

    <title>A Comprehensive Python Library for Deep Learning-Based Event Detection
  in Multivariate Time Series Data and Information Retrieval in NLP</title>
    <summary>  Event detection in time series data is crucial in various domains, including
finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and science. Accurately identifying events
in time series data is vital for making informed decisions, detecting
anomalies, and predicting future trends. Despite extensive research exploring
diverse methods for event detection in time series, with deep learning
approaches being among the most advanced, there is still room for improvement
and innovation in this field. In this paper, we present a new deep learning
supervised method for detecting events in multivariate time series data. Our
method combines four distinct novelties compared to existing deep-learning
supervised methods. Firstly, it is based on regression instead of binary
classification. Secondly, it does not require labeled datasets where each point
is labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time points
or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be robust by using a stacked
ensemble learning meta-model that combines deep learning models, ranging from
classic feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) to state-of-the-art architectures
like transformers. This ensemble approach can mitigate individual model
weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions. Finally, to
facilitate practical implementation, we have developed a Python package to
accompany our proposed method. The package, called eventdetector-ts, can be
installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). In this paper, we present
our method and provide a comprehensive guide on the usage of the package. We
showcase its versatility and effectiveness through different real-world use
cases from natural language processing (NLP) to financial security domains.

    <title>Relaxed Parameter Sharing: Effectively Modeling Time-Varying
  Relationships in Clinical Time-Series</title>
    <summary>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly applied to clinical time-series
data with the goal of learning patient risk stratification models. Their
effectiveness is due, in part, to their use of parameter sharing over time
(i.e., cells are repeated hence the name recurrent). We hypothesize, however,
that this trait also contributes to the increased difficulty such models have
with learning relationships that change over time. Conditional shift, i.e.,
changes in the relationship between the input X and the output y, arises when
risk factors associated with the event of interest change over the course of a
patient admission. While in theory, RNNs and gated RNNs (e.g., LSTMs) in
particular should be capable of learning time-varying relationships, when
training data are limited, such models often fail to accurately capture these
dynamics. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of complete parameter
sharing (RNNs) by comparing an LSTM with shared parameters to a sequential
architecture with time-varying parameters on prediction tasks involving three
clinically-relevant outcomes: acute respiratory failure (ARF), shock, and
in-hospital mortality. In experiments using synthetic data, we demonstrate how
parameter sharing in LSTMs leads to worse performance in the presence of
conditional shift. To improve upon the dichotomy between complete parameter
sharing and no parameter sharing, we propose a novel RNN formulation based on a
mixture model in which we relax parameter sharing over time. The proposed
method outperforms standard LSTMs and other state-of-the-art baselines across
all tasks. In settings with limited data, relaxed parameter sharing can lead to
improved patient risk stratification performance.

    <title>Early detection of inflammatory arthritis to improve referrals using
  multimodal machine learning from blood testing, semi-structured and
  unstructured patient records</title>
    <summary>  Early detection of inflammatory arthritis (IA) is critical to efficient and
accurate hospital referral triage for timely treatment and preventing the
deterioration of the IA disease course, especially under limited healthcare
resources. The manual assessment process is the most common approach in
practice for the early detection of IA, but it is extremely labor-intensive and
inefficient. A large amount of clinical information needs to be assessed for
every referral from General Practice (GP) to the hospitals. Machine learning
shows great potential in automating repetitive assessment tasks and providing
decision support for the early detection of IA. However, most machine
learning-based methods for IA detection rely on blood testing results. But in
practice, blood testing data is not always available at the point of referrals,
so we need methods to leverage multimodal data such as semi-structured and
unstructured data for early detection of IA. In this research, we present
fusion and ensemble learning-based methods using multimodal data to assist
decision-making in the early detection of IA, and a conformal prediction-based
method to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction and detect any unreliable
predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to
utilize multimodal data to support the early detection of IA from GP referrals.

    <title>Co-Morbidity Exploration on Wearables Activity Data Using Unsupervised
  Pre-training and Multi-Task Learning</title>
    <summary>  Physical activity and sleep play a major role in the prevention and
management of many chronic conditions. It is not a trivial task to understand
their impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health
records (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid
increase in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant
new data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time
through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,
potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,
sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This
is a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare
decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new
opportunity to overcome this barrier.
  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major
fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a
novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning
technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account
the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity
patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the
performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since
many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as
co-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared
structure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the
wearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects
shows that our proposed method performs and generalizes substantially better
than the conventional time-series symbolic representational methods and
task-specific deep learning models.

    <title>Deep reinforcement learning in medical imaging: A literature review</title>
    <summary>  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) augments the reinforcement learning
framework, which learns a sequence of actions that maximizes the expected
reward, with the representative power of deep neural networks. Recent works
have demonstrated the great potential of DRL in medicine and healthcare. This
paper presents a literature review of DRL in medical imaging. We start with a
comprehensive tutorial of DRL, including the latest model-free and model-based
algorithms. We then cover existing DRL applications for medical imaging, which
are roughly divided into three main categories: (I) parametric medical image
analysis tasks including landmark detection, object/lesion detection,
registration, and view plane localization; (ii) solving optimization tasks
including hyperparameter tuning, selecting augmentation strategies, and neural
architecture search; and (iii) miscellaneous applications including surgical
gesture segmentation, personalized mobile health intervention, and
computational model personalization. The paper concludes with discussions of
future perspectives.

    <title>Optimizing Warfarin Dosing Using Contextual Bandit: An Offline Policy
  Learning and Evaluation Method</title>
    <summary>  Warfarin, an anticoagulant medication, is formulated to prevent and address
conditions associated with abnormal blood clotting, making it one of the most
prescribed drugs globally. However, determining the suitable dosage remains
challenging due to individual response variations, and prescribing an incorrect
dosage may lead to severe consequences. Contextual bandit and reinforcement
learning have shown promise in addressing this issue. Given the wide
availability of observational data and safety concerns of decision-making in
healthcare, we focused on using exclusively observational data from historical
policies as demonstrations to derive new policies; we utilized offline policy
learning and evaluation in a contextual bandit setting to establish the optimal
personalized dosage strategy. Our learned policies surpassed these baseline
approaches without genotype inputs, even when given a suboptimal demonstration,
showcasing promising application potential.

    <title>Automated Task-Time Interventions to Improve Teamwork using Imitation
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  Effective human-human and human-autonomy teamwork is critical but often
challenging to perfect. The challenge is particularly relevant in time-critical
domains, such as healthcare and disaster response, where the time pressures can
make coordination increasingly difficult to achieve and the consequences of
imperfect coordination can be severe. To improve teamwork in these and other
domains, we present TIC: an automated intervention approach for improving
coordination between team members. Using BTIL, a multi-agent imitation learning
algorithm, our approach first learns a generative model of team behavior from
past task execution data. Next, it utilizes the learned generative model and
team's task objective (shared reward) to algorithmically generate
execution-time interventions. We evaluate our approach in synthetic multi-agent
teaming scenarios, where team members make decentralized decisions without full
observability of the environment. The experiments demonstrate that the
automated interventions can successfully improve team performance and shed
light on the design of autonomous agents for improving teamwork.

    <title>Using Kernel Methods and Model Selection for Prediction of Preterm Birth</title>
    <summary>  We describe an application of machine learning to the problem of predicting
preterm birth. We conduct a secondary analysis on a clinical trial dataset
collected by the National In- stitute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) while focusing our attention on predicting different classes of preterm
birth. We compare three approaches for deriving predictive models: a support
vector machine (SVM) approach with linear and non-linear kernels, logistic
regression with different model selection along with a model based on decision
rules prescribed by physician experts for prediction of preterm birth. Our
approach highlights the pre-processing methods applied to handle the inherent
dynamics, noise and gaps in the data and describe techniques used to handle
skewed class distributions. Empirical experiments demonstrate significant
improvement in predicting preterm birth compared to past work.

    <title>Unveiling the frontiers of deep learning: innovations shaping diverse
  domains</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL) enables the development of computer models that are
capable of learning, visualizing, optimizing, refining, and predicting data. In
recent years, DL has been applied in a range of fields, including audio-visual
data processing, agriculture, transportation prediction, natural language,
biomedicine, disaster management, bioinformatics, drug design, genomics, face
recognition, and ecology. To explore the current state of deep learning, it is
necessary to investigate the latest developments and applications of deep
learning in these disciplines. However, the literature is lacking in exploring
the applications of deep learning in all potential sectors. This paper thus
extensively investigates the potential applications of deep learning across all
major fields of study as well as the associated benefits and challenges. As
evidenced in the literature, DL exhibits accuracy in prediction and analysis,
makes it a powerful computational tool, and has the ability to articulate
itself and optimize, making it effective in processing data with no prior
training. Given its independence from training data, deep learning necessitates
massive amounts of data for effective analysis and processing, much like data
volume. To handle the challenge of compiling huge amounts of medical,
scientific, healthcare, and environmental data for use in deep learning, gated
architectures like LSTMs and GRUs can be utilized. For multimodal learning,
shared neurons in the neural network for all activities and specialized neurons
for particular tasks are necessary.

    <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for Electronic Health Records: A
  Framework for Exploring and Evaluating Methods for Predicting Drug-Induced
  Laboratory Test Trajectories</title>
    <summary>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a promising class of
generative networks that combine neural networks with game theory. From
generating realistic images and videos to assisting musical creation, GANs are
transforming many fields of arts and sciences. However, their application to
healthcare has not been fully realized, more specifically in generating
electronic health records (EHR) data. In this paper, we propose a framework for
exploring the value of GANs in the context of continuous laboratory time series
data. We devise an unsupervised evaluation method that measures the predictive
power of synthetic laboratory test time series. Further, we show that when it
comes to predicting the impact of drug exposure on laboratory test data,
incorporating representation learning of the training cohorts prior to training
GAN models is beneficial.

    <title>Siamese Survival Analysis with Competing Risks</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis in the presence of multiple possible adverse events, i.e.,
competing risks, is a pervasive problem in many industries (healthcare,
finance, etc.). Since only one event is typically observed, the incidence of an
event of interest is often obscured by other related competing events. This
nonidentifiability, or inability to estimate true cause-specific survival
curves from empirical data, further complicates competing risk survival
analysis. We introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network (SSPN), a novel deep
learning architecture for estimating personalized risk scores in the presence
of competing risks. SSPN circumvents the nonidentifiability problem by avoiding
the estimation of cause-specific survival curves and instead determines
pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, where longer event times are assigned
lower risks. Furthermore, SSPN is able to directly optimize an approximation to
the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics which are
unable to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing
risks.

    <title>Towards Continuous Domain adaptation for Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated tremendous success on challenging
medical imaging problems. However, post-deployment, these algorithms are
susceptible to data distribution variations owing to \emph{limited data issues}
and \emph{diversity} in medical images. In this paper, we propose
\emph{ContextNets}, a generic memory-augmented neural network framework for
semantic segmentation to achieve continuous domain adaptation without the
necessity of retraining. Unlike existing methods which require access to entire
source and target domain images, our algorithm can adapt to a target domain
with a few similar images. We condition the inference on any new input with
features computed on its support set of images (and masks, if available)
through contextual embeddings to achieve site-specific adaptation. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on the X-ray lung
segmentation problem from three independent cohorts that differ in disease
type, gender, contrast and intensity variations.

    <title>Neural Decomposition: Functional ANOVA with Variational Autoencoders</title>
    <summary>  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a popular approach for
dimensionality reduction. However, despite their ability to identify latent
low-dimensional structures embedded within high-dimensional data, these latent
representations are typically hard to interpret on their own. Due to the
black-box nature of VAEs, their utility for healthcare and genomics
applications has been limited. In this paper, we focus on characterising the
sources of variation in Conditional VAEs. Our goal is to provide a
feature-level variance decomposition, i.e. to decompose variation in the data
by separating out the marginal additive effects of latent variables z and fixed
inputs c from their non-linear interactions. We propose to achieve this through
what we call Neural Decomposition - an adaptation of the well-known concept of
functional ANOVA variance decomposition from classical statistics to deep
learning models. We show how identifiability can be achieved by training models
subject to constraints on the marginal properties of the decoder networks. We
demonstrate the utility of our Neural Decomposition on a series of synthetic
examples as well as high-dimensional genomics data.

    <title>A Survey on Practical Applications of Multi-Armed and Contextual Bandits</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework has attracted a lot of
attention in various applications, from recommender systems and information
retrieval to healthcare and finance, due to its stellar performance combined
with certain attractive properties, such as learning from less feedback. The
multi-armed bandit field is currently flourishing, as novel problem settings
and algorithms motivated by various practical applications are being
introduced, building on top of the classical bandit problem. This article aims
to provide a comprehensive review of top recent developments in multiple
real-life applications of the multi-armed bandit. Specifically, we introduce a
taxonomy of common MAB-based applications and summarize state-of-art for each
of those domains. Furthermore, we identify important current trends and provide
new perspectives pertaining to the future of this exciting and fast-growing
field.

    <title>End-To-End Prediction of Emotion From Heartbeat Data Collected by a
  Consumer Fitness Tracker</title>
    <summary>  Automatic detection of emotion has the potential to revolutionize mental
health and wellbeing. Recent work has been successful in predicting affect from
unimodal electrocardiogram (ECG) data. However, to be immediately relevant for
real-world applications, physiology-based emotion detection must make use of
ubiquitous photoplethysmogram (PPG) data collected by affordable consumer
fitness trackers. Additionally, applications of emotion detection in healthcare
settings will require some measure of uncertainty over model predictions. We
present here a Bayesian deep learning model for end-to-end classification of
emotional valence, using only the unimodal heartbeat time series collected by a
consumer fitness tracker (Garmin V\'ivosmart 3). We collected a new dataset for
this task, and report a peak F1 score of 0.7. This demonstrates a practical
relevance of physiology-based emotion detection `in the wild' today.

    <title>Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Network on Electronic Health
  Records</title>
    <summary>  Mining Electronic Health Records (EHRs) becomes a promising topic because of
the rich information they contain. By learning from EHRs, machine learning
models can be built to help human experts to make medical decisions and thus
improve healthcare quality. Recently, many models based on sequential or graph
models are proposed to achieve this goal. EHRs contain multiple entities and
relations and can be viewed as a heterogeneous graph. However, previous studies
ignore the heterogeneity in EHRs. On the other hand, current heterogeneous
graph neural networks cannot be simply used on an EHR graph because of the
existence of hub nodes in it. To address this issue, we propose Heterogeneous
Similarity Graph Neural Network (HSGNN) analyze EHRs with a novel heterogeneous
GNN. Our framework consists of two parts: one is a preprocessing method and the
other is an end-to-end GNN. The preprocessing method normalizes edges and
splits the EHR graph into multiple homogeneous graphs while each homogeneous
graph contains partial information of the original EHR graph. The GNN takes all
homogeneous graphs as input and fuses all of them into one graph to make a
prediction. Experimental results show that HSGNN outperforms other baselines in
the diagnosis prediction task.

    <title>Weakly Supervised Classification of Vital Sign Alerts as Real or
  Artifact</title>
    <summary>  A significant proportion of clinical physiologic monitoring alarms are false.
This often leads to alarm fatigue in clinical personnel, inevitably
compromising patient safety. To combat this issue, researchers have attempted
to build Machine Learning (ML) models capable of accurately adjudicating Vital
Sign (VS) alerts raised at the bedside of hemodynamically monitored patients as
real or artifact. Previous studies have utilized supervised ML techniques that
require substantial amounts of hand-labeled data. However, manually harvesting
such data can be costly, time-consuming, and mundane, and is a key factor
limiting the widespread adoption of ML in healthcare (HC). Instead, we explore
the use of multiple, individually imperfect heuristics to automatically assign
probabilistic labels to unlabeled training data using weak supervision. Our
weakly supervised models perform competitively with traditional supervised
techniques and require less involvement from domain experts, demonstrating
their use as efficient and practical alternatives to supervised learning in HC
applications of ML.

    <title>AutoML Systems For Medical Imaging</title>
    <summary>  The integration of machine learning in medical image analysis can greatly
enhance the quality of healthcare provided by physicians. The combination of
human expertise and computerized systems can result in improved diagnostic
accuracy. An automated machine learning approach simplifies the creation of
custom image recognition models by utilizing neural architecture search and
transfer learning techniques. Medical imaging techniques are used to
non-invasively create images of internal organs and body parts for diagnostic
and procedural purposes. This article aims to highlight the potential
applications, strategies, and techniques of AutoML in medical imaging through
theoretical and empirical evidence.

    <title>Proportional Response: Contextual Bandits for Simple and Cumulative
  Regret Minimization</title>
    <summary>  In many applications, e.g. in healthcare and e-commerce, the goal of a
contextual bandit may be to learn an optimal treatment assignment policy at the
end of the experiment. That is, to minimize simple regret. However, this
objective remains understudied. We propose a new family of computationally
efficient bandit algorithms for the stochastic contextual bandit setting, where
a tuning parameter determines the weight placed on cumulative regret
minimization (where we establish near-optimal minimax guarantees) versus simple
regret minimization (where we establish state-of-the-art guarantees). Our
algorithms work with any function class, are robust to model misspecification,
and can be used in continuous arm settings. This flexibility comes from
constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets" (CASs). CASs provide a set of
arms for every context, encompassing the context-specific optimal arm with a
certain probability across the context distribution. Our positive results on
simple and cumulative regret guarantees are contrasted with a negative result,
which shows that no algorithm can achieve instance-dependent simple regret
guarantees while simultaneously achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret
guarantees.

    <title>Machine Learning Meets Advanced Robotic Manipulation</title>
    <summary>  Automated industries lead to high quality production, lower manufacturing
cost and better utilization of human resources. Robotic manipulator arms have
major role in the automation process. However, for complex manipulation tasks,
hard coding efficient and safe trajectories is challenging and time consuming.
Machine learning methods have the potential to learn such controllers based on
expert demonstrations. Despite promising advances, better approaches must be
developed to improve safety, reliability, and efficiency of ML methods in both
training and deployment phases. This survey aims to review cutting edge
technologies and recent trends on ML methods applied to real-world manipulation
tasks. After reviewing the related background on ML, the rest of the paper is
devoted to ML applications in different domains such as industry, healthcare,
agriculture, space, military, and search and rescue. The paper is closed with
important research directions for future works.

    <title>A Temporally Disentangled Contrastive Diffusion Model for Spatiotemporal
  Imputation</title>
    <summary>  Spatiotemporal data analysis is pivotal across various domains, such as
transportation, meteorology, and healthcare. The data collected in real-world
scenarios are often incomplete due to device malfunctions and network errors.
Spatiotemporal imputation aims to predict missing values by exploiting the
spatial and temporal dependencies in the observed data. Traditional imputation
approaches based on statistical and machine learning techniques require the
data to conform to their distributional assumptions, while graph and recurrent
neural networks are prone to error accumulation problems due to their recurrent
structures. Generative models, especially diffusion models, can potentially
circumvent the reliance on inaccurate, previously imputed values for future
predictions; However, diffusion models still face challenges in generating
stable results. We propose to address these challenges by designing conditional
information to guide the generative process and expedite the training process.
We introduce a conditional diffusion framework called C$^2$TSD, which
incorporates disentangled temporal (trend and seasonality) representations as
conditional information and employs contrastive learning to improve
generalizability. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to a number of
state-of-the-art baselines.

    <title>CONFINE: Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks exhibit remarkable performance, yet their black-box
nature limits their utility in fields like healthcare where interpretability is
crucial. Existing explainability approaches often sacrifice accuracy and lack
quantifiable measures of prediction uncertainty. In this study, we introduce
Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks (CONFINE), a versatile
framework that generates prediction sets with statistically robust uncertainty
estimates instead of point predictions to enhance model transparency and
reliability. CONFINE not only provides example-based explanations and
confidence estimates for individual predictions but also boosts accuracy by up
to 3.6%. We define a new metric, correct efficiency, to evaluate the fraction
of prediction sets that contain precisely the correct label and show that
CONFINE achieves correct efficiency of up to 3.3% higher than the original
accuracy, matching or exceeding prior methods. CONFINE's marginal and
class-conditional coverages attest to its validity across tasks spanning
medical image classification to language understanding. Being adaptable to any
pre-trained classifier, CONFINE marks a significant advance towards transparent
and trustworthy deep learning applications in critical domains.

    <title>Justification-Based Reliability in Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  With the advent of Deep Learning, the field of machine learning (ML) has
surpassed human-level performance on diverse classification tasks. At the same
time, there is a stark need to characterize and quantify reliability of a
model's prediction on individual samples. This is especially true in
application of such models in safety-critical domains of industrial control and
healthcare. To address this need, we link the question of reliability of a
model's individual prediction to the epistemic uncertainty of the model's
prediction. More specifically, we extend the theory of Justified True Belief
(JTB) in epistemology, created to study the validity and limits of
human-acquired knowledge, towards characterizing the validity and limits of
knowledge in supervised classifiers. We present an analysis of neural network
classifiers linking the reliability of its prediction on an input to
characteristics of the support gathered from the input and latent spaces of the
network. We hypothesize that the JTB analysis exposes the epistemic uncertainty
(or ignorance) of a model with respect to its inference, thereby allowing for
the inference to be only as strong as the justification permits. We explore
various forms of support (for e.g., k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and l_p-norm
based) generated for an input, using the training data to construct a
justification for the prediction with that input. Through experiments conducted
on simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can provide
reliability for individual predictions and characterize regions where such
reliability cannot be ascertained.

    <title>Survival Prediction of Heart Failure Patients using Stacked Ensemble
  Machine Learning Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  Cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure is one of the major health
hazard issues of our time and is a leading cause of death worldwide.
Advancement in data mining techniques using machine learning (ML) models is
paving promising prediction approaches. Data mining is the process of
converting massive volumes of raw data created by the healthcare institutions
into meaningful information that can aid in making predictions and crucial
decisions. Collecting various follow-up data from patients who have had heart
failures, analyzing those data, and utilizing several ML models to predict the
survival possibility of cardiovascular patients is the key aim of this study.
Due to the imbalance of the classes in the dataset, Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been implemented. Two unsupervised models
(K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering) and three supervised classifiers (Random
Forest, XGBoost and Decision Tree) have been used in our study. After thorough
investigation, our results demonstrate a superior performance of the supervised
ML algorithms over unsupervised models. Moreover, we designed and propose a
supervised stacked ensemble learning model that can achieve an accuracy,
precision, recall and F1 score of 99.98%. Our study shows that only certain
attributes collected from the patients are imperative to successfully predict
the surviving possibility post heart failure, using supervised ML algorithms.

    <title>An actor-critic algorithm with policy gradients to solve the job shop
  scheduling problem using deep double recurrent agents</title>
    <summary>  There is a growing interest in integrating machine learning techniques and
optimization to solve challenging optimization problems. In this work, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning methodology for the job shop scheduling
problem (JSSP). The aim is to build up a greedy-like heuristic able to learn on
some distribution of JSSP instances, different in the number of jobs and
machines. The need for fast scheduling methods is well known, and it arises in
many areas, from transportation to healthcare. We model the JSSP as a Markov
Decision Process and then we exploit the efficacy of reinforcement learning to
solve the problem. We adopt an actor-critic scheme, where the action taken by
the agent is influenced by policy considerations on the state-value function.
The procedures are adapted to take into account the challenging nature of JSSP,
where the state and the action space change not only for every instance but
also after each decision. To tackle the variability in the number of jobs and
operations in the input, we modeled the agent using two incident LSTM models, a
special type of deep neural network. Experiments show the algorithm reaches
good solutions in a short time, proving that is possible to generate new greedy
heuristics just from learning-based methodologies. Benchmarks have been
generated in comparison with the commercial solver CPLEX. As expected, the
model can generalize, to some extent, to larger problems or instances
originated by a different distribution from the one used in training.

    <title>Trident: Efficient 4PC Framework for Privacy Preserving Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning has started to be deployed in fields such as healthcare and
finance, which propelled the need for and growth of privacy-preserving machine
learning (PPML). We propose an actively secure four-party protocol (4PC), and a
framework for PPML, showcasing its applications on four of the most
widely-known machine learning algorithms -- Linear Regression, Logistic
Regression, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. Our 4PC
protocol tolerating at most one malicious corruption is practically efficient
as compared to the existing works. We use the protocol to build an efficient
mixed-world framework (Trident) to switch between the Arithmetic, Boolean, and
Garbled worlds. Our framework operates in the offline-online paradigm over
rings and is instantiated in an outsourced setting for machine learning. Also,
we propose conversions especially relevant to privacy-preserving machine
learning. The highlights of our framework include using a minimal number of
expensive circuits overall as compared to ABY3. This can be seen in our
technique for truncation, which does not affect the online cost of
multiplication and removes the need for any circuits in the offline phase. Our
B2A conversion has an improvement of $\mathbf{7} \times$ in rounds and
$\mathbf{18} \times$ in the communication complexity. The practicality of our
framework is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of the
aforementioned algorithms when compared with ABY3. All the protocols are
implemented over a 64-bit ring in both LAN and WAN settings. Our improvements
go up to $\mathbf{187} \times$ for the training phase and $\mathbf{158} \times$
for the prediction phase when observed over LAN and WAN.

    <title>Quantum kernels for real-world predictions based on electronic health
  records</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, research on near-term quantum machine learning has explored
how classical machine learning algorithms endowed with access to quantum
kernels (similarity measures) can outperform their purely classical
counterparts. Although theoretical work has shown provable advantage on
synthetic data sets, no work done to date has studied empirically whether
quantum advantage is attainable and with what kind of data set. In this paper,
we report the first systematic investigation of empirical quantum advantage
(EQA) in healthcare and life sciences and propose an end-to-end framework to
study EQA. We selected electronic health records (EHRs) data subsets and
created a configuration space of 5-20 features and 200-300 training samples.
For each configuration coordinate, we trained classical support vector machine
(SVM) models based on radial basis function (RBF) kernels and quantum models
with custom kernels using an IBM quantum computer, making this one of the
largest quantum machine learning experiments to date. We empirically identified
regimes where quantum kernels could provide advantage on a particular data set
and introduced a terrain ruggedness index, a metric to help quantitatively
estimate how the accuracy of a given model will perform as a function of the
number of features and sample size. The generalizable framework introduced here
represents a key step towards a priori identification of data sets where
quantum advantage could exist.

    <title>Adversarial Multi-Source Transfer Learning in Healthcare: Application to
  Glucose Prediction for Diabetic People</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning has yet to revolutionize general practices in healthcare,
despite promising results for some specific tasks. This is partly due to data
being in insufficient quantities hurting the training of the models. To address
this issue, data from multiple health actors or patients could be combined by
capitalizing on their heterogeneity through the use of transfer learning.
  To improve the quality of the transfer between multiple sources of data, we
propose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning framework that enables the
learning of a feature representation that is similar across the sources, and
thus more general and more easily transferable. We apply this idea to glucose
forecasting for diabetic people using a fully convolutional neural network. The
evaluation is done by exploring various transfer scenarios with three datasets
characterized by their high inter and intra variability.
  While transferring knowledge is beneficial in general, we show that the
statistical and clinical accuracies can be further improved by using of the
adversarial training methodology, surpassing the current state-of-the-art
results. In particular, it shines when using data from different datasets, or
when there is too little data in an intra-dataset situation. To understand the
behavior of the models, we analyze the learnt feature representations and
propose a new metric in this regard. Contrary to a standard transfer, the
adversarial transfer does not discriminate the patients and datasets, helping
the learning of a more general feature representation.
  The adversarial training framework improves the learning of a general feature
representation in a multi-source environment, enhancing the knowledge transfer
to an unseen target.
  The proposed method can help improve the efficiency of data shared by
different health actors in the training of deep models.

    <title>Curriculum Design Helps Spiking Neural Networks to Classify Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have a greater potential for modeling time
series data than Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), due to their inherent
neuron dynamics and low energy consumption. However, it is difficult to
demonstrate their superiority in classification accuracy, because current
efforts mainly focus on designing better network structures. In this work,
enlighten by brain-inspired science, we find that, not only the structure but
also the learning process should be human-like. To achieve this, we investigate
the power of Curriculum Learning (CL) on SNNs by designing a novel method named
CSNN with two theoretically guaranteed mechanisms: The active-to-dormant
training order makes the curriculum similar to that of human learning and
suitable for spiking neurons; The value-based regional encoding makes the
neuron activity to mimic the brain memory when learning sequential data.
Experiments on multiple time series sources including simulated, sensor,
motion, and healthcare demonstrate that CL has a more positive effect on SNNs
than ANNs with about twice the accuracy change, and CSNN can increase about 3%
SNNs' accuracy by improving network sparsity, neuron firing status, anti-noise
ability, and convergence speed.

    <title>ULTRA-MC: A Unified Approach to Learning Mixtures of Markov Chains via
  Hitting Times</title>
    <summary>  This study introduces a novel approach for learning mixtures of Markov
chains, a critical process applicable to various fields, including healthcare
and the analysis of web users. Existing research has identified a clear divide
in methodologies for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov
chains, while the latter presents additional complexities for recovery accuracy
and efficiency.
  We introduce a unifying strategy for learning mixtures of discrete and
continuous-time Markov chains, focusing on hitting times, which are well
defined for both types. Specifically, we design a reconstruction algorithm that
outputs a mixture which accurately reflects the estimated hitting times and
demonstrates resilience to noise. We introduce an efficient gradient-descent
approach, specifically tailored to manage the computational complexity and
non-symmetric characteristics inherent in the calculation of hitting time
derivatives. Our approach is also of significant interest when applied to a
single Markov chain, thus extending the methodologies previously established by
Hoskins et al. and Wittmann et al. We complement our theoretical work with
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of our methodology.

    <title>Meta-FL: A Novel Meta-Learning Framework for Optimizing Heterogeneous
  Model Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across diverse
entities while safeguarding data privacy. However, FL faces challenges such as
data heterogeneity and model diversity. The Meta-Federated Learning (Meta-FL)
framework has been introduced to tackle these challenges. Meta-FL employs an
optimization-based Meta-Aggregator to navigate the complexities of
heterogeneous model updates. The Meta-Aggregator enhances the global model's
performance by leveraging meta-features, ensuring a tailored aggregation that
accounts for each local model's accuracy. Empirical evaluation across four
healthcare-related datasets demonstrates the Meta-FL framework's adaptability,
efficiency, scalability, and robustness, outperforming conventional FL
approaches. Furthermore, Meta-FL's remarkable efficiency and scalability are
evident in its achievement of superior accuracy with fewer communication rounds
and its capacity to manage expanding federated networks without compromising
performance.

    <title>Policy-Based Bayesian Experimental Design for Non-Differentiable
  Implicit Models</title>
    <summary>  For applications in healthcare, physics, energy, robotics, and many other
fields, designing maximally informative experiments is valuable, particularly
when experiments are expensive, time-consuming, or pose safety hazards. While
existing approaches can sequentially design experiments based on prior
observation history, many of these methods do not extend to implicit models,
where simulation is possible but computing the likelihood is intractable.
Furthermore, they often require either significant online computation during
deployment or a differentiable simulation system. We introduce Reinforcement
Learning for Deep Adaptive Design (RL-DAD), a method for simulation-based
optimal experimental design for non-differentiable implicit models. RL-DAD
extends prior work in policy-based Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED)
by reformulating it as a Markov Decision Process with a reward function based
on likelihood-free information lower bounds, which is used to learn a policy
via deep reinforcement learning. The learned design policy maps prior histories
to experiment designs offline and can be quickly deployed during online
execution. We evaluate RL-DAD and find that it performs competitively with
baselines on three benchmarks.

    <title>A review of Deep learning Techniques for COVID-19 identification on
  Chest CT images</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humanity that directly
affects the lungs. Automatic identification of COVID-19 is a challenge for
health care officials. The standard gold method for diagnosing COVID-19 is
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to collect swabs from
affected people. Some limitations encountered while collecting swabs are
related to accuracy and longtime duration. Chest CT (Computed Tomography) is
another test method that helps healthcare providers quickly identify the
infected lung areas. It was used as a supporting tool for identifying COVID-19
in an earlier stage. With the help of deep learning, the CT imaging
characteristics of COVID-19. Researchers have proven it to be highly effective
for COVID-19 CT image classification. In this study, we review the recent deep
learning techniques that can use to detect the COVID-19 disease. Relevant
studies were collected by various databases such as Web of Science, Google
Scholar, and PubMed. Finally, we compare the results of different deep learning
models, and CT image analysis is discussed.

    <title>Preserving Causal Constraints in Counterfactual Explanations for Machine
  Learning Classifiers</title>
    <summary>  To construct interpretable explanations that are consistent with the original
ML model, counterfactual examples---showing how the model's output changes with
small perturbations to the input---have been proposed. This paper extends the
work in counterfactual explanations by addressing the challenge of feasibility
of such examples. For explanations of ML models in critical domains such as
healthcare and finance, counterfactual examples are useful for an end-user only
to the extent that perturbation of feature inputs is feasible in the real
world. We formulate the problem of feasibility as preserving causal
relationships among input features and present a method that uses (partial)
structural causal models to generate actionable counterfactuals. When
feasibility constraints cannot be easily expressed, we consider an alternative
mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether
it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the
original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a
modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that
optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output. Our experiments
on Bayesian networks and the widely used ''Adult-Income'' dataset show that our
proposed methods can generate counterfactual explanations that better satisfy
feasibility constraints than existing methods.. Code repository can be accessed

    <title>Learning "What-if" Explanations for Sequential Decision-Making</title>
    <summary>  Building interpretable parameterizations of real-world decision-making on the
basis of demonstrated behavior -- i.e. trajectories of observations and actions
made by an expert maximizing some unknown reward function -- is essential for
introspecting and auditing policies in different institutions. In this paper,
we propose learning explanations of expert decisions by modeling their reward
function in terms of preferences with respect to "what if" outcomes: Given the
current history of observations, what would happen if we took a particular
action? To learn these cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with the expert's
actions, we integrate counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement
learning. This offers a principled way of defining reward functions and
explaining expert behavior, and also satisfies the constraints of real-world
decision-making -- where active experimentation is often impossible (e.g. in
healthcare). Additionally, by estimating the effects of different actions,
counterfactuals readily tackle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in
the batch setting, and can naturally accommodate settings where the expert
policies depend on histories of observations rather than just current states.
Through illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical
environments, we highlight the effectiveness of our batch, counterfactual
inverse reinforcement learning approach in recovering accurate and
interpretable descriptions of behavior.

    <title>Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Counterfactual-Based Data
  Augmentation</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms usually require a substantial amount
of interaction data and perform well only for specific tasks in a fixed
environment. In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few
records are available for each patient, and patients may show different
responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL
algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism
heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL
algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state
dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences
across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what
would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real
(possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences
lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both
population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual
outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the
counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value
function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach.

    <title>Task-aware Similarity Learning for Event-triggered Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Time series analysis has achieved great success in diverse applications such
as network security, environmental monitoring, and medical informatics.
Learning similarities among different time series is a crucial problem since it
serves as the foundation for downstream analysis such as clustering and anomaly
detection. It often remains unclear what kind of distance metric is suitable
for similarity learning due to the complex temporal dynamics of the time series
generated from event-triggered sensing, which is common in diverse
applications, including automated driving, interactive healthcare, and smart
home automation. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an
unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning task-aware
similarities among unlabeled event-triggered time series. From the machine
learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both
hierarchical multi-scale sequence autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series.
Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for
explaining. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives
rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude
of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

    <title>Alzheimer's Magnetic Resonance Imaging Classification Using Deep and
  Meta-Learning Models</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning, a cutting-edge machine learning approach, outperforms
traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex
high-dimensional data, particularly in the domain of healthcare. This study
focuses on classifying Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for Alzheimer's
disease (AD) by leveraging deep learning techniques characterized by
state-of-the-art CNNs. Brain imaging techniques such as MRI have enabled the
measurement of pathophysiological brain changes related to Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, and it is
an irreversible brain illness that causes gradual cognitive function disorder.
In this paper, we train some benchmark deep models individually for the
approach of the solution and later use an ensembling approach to combine the
effect of multiple CNNs towards the observation of higher recall and accuracy.
Here, the model's effectiveness is evaluated using various methods, including
stacking, majority voting, and the combination of models with high recall
values. The majority voting performs better than the alternative modelling
approach as the majority voting approach typically reduces the variance in the
predictions. We report a test accuracy of 90% with a precision score of 0.90
and a recall score of 0.89 in our proposed approach. In future, this study can
be extended to incorporate other types of medical data, including signals,
images, and other data. The same or alternative datasets can be used with
additional classifiers, neural networks, and AI techniques to enhance
Alzheimer's detection.

    <title>Privacy Preserving Federated Learning in Medical Imaging with
  Uncertainty Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have fueled remarkable
advancements, particularly in healthcare. Within medical imaging, ML models
hold the promise of improving disease diagnoses, treatment planning, and
post-treatment monitoring. Various computer vision tasks like image
classification, object detection, and image segmentation are poised to become
routine in clinical analysis. However, privacy concerns surrounding patient
data hinder the assembly of large training datasets needed for developing and
training accurate, robust, and generalizable models. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a compelling solution, enabling organizations to collaborate on ML
model training by sharing model training information (gradients) rather than
data (e.g., medical images). FL's distributed learning framework facilitates
inter-institutional collaboration while preserving patient privacy. However,
FL, while robust in privacy preservation, faces several challenges. Sensitive
information can still be gleaned from shared gradients that are passed on
between organizations during model training. Additionally, in medical imaging,
quantifying model confidence\uncertainty accurately is crucial due to the noise
and artifacts present in the data. Uncertainty estimation in FL encounters
unique hurdles due to data heterogeneity across organizations. This paper
offers a comprehensive review of FL, privacy preservation, and uncertainty
estimation, with a focus on medical imaging. Alongside a survey of current
research, we identify gaps in the field and suggest future directions for FL
research to enhance privacy and address noisy medical imaging data challenges.

    <title>GAMENet: Graph Augmented MEmory Networks for Recommending Medication
  Combination</title>
    <summary>  Recent progress in deep learning is revolutionizing the healthcare domain
including providing solutions to medication recommendations, especially
recommending medication combination for patients with complex health
conditions. Existing approaches either do not customize based on patient health
history, or ignore existing knowledge on drug-drug interactions (DDI) that
might lead to adverse outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose the Graph
Augmented Memory Networks (GAMENet), which integrates the drug-drug
interactions knowledge graph by a memory module implemented as a graph
convolutional networks, and models longitudinal patient records as the query.
It is trained end-to-end to provide safe and personalized recommendation of
medication combination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of GAMENet
by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on real EHR data. GAMENet
outperformed all baselines in all effectiveness measures, and also achieved
3.60% DDI rate reduction from existing EHR data.

    <title>A survey of image labelling for computer vision applications</title>
    <summary>  Supervised machine learning methods for image analysis require large amounts
of labelled training data to solve computer vision problems. The recent rise of
deep learning algorithms for recognising image content has led to the emergence
of many ad-hoc labelling tools. With this survey, we capture and systematise
the commonalities as well as the distinctions between existing image labelling
software. We perform a structured literature review to compile the underlying
concepts and features of image labelling software such as annotation
expressiveness and degree of automation. We structure the manual labelling task
by its organisation of work, user interface design options, and user support
techniques to derive a systematisation schema for this survey. Applying it to
available software and the body of literature, enabled us to uncover several
application archetypes and key domains such as image retrieval or instance
identification in healthcare or television.

    <title>Binarised Regression with Instance-Varying Costs: Evaluation using
  Impact Curves</title>
    <summary>  Many evaluation methods exist, each for a particular prediction task, and
there are a number of prediction tasks commonly performed including
classification and regression. In binarised regression, binary decisions are
generated from a learned regression model (or real-valued dependent variable),
which is useful when the division between instances that should be predicted
positive or negative depends on the utility. For example, in mining, the
boundary between a valuable rock and a waste rock depends on the market price
of various metals, which varies with time. This paper proposes impact curves to
evaluate binarised regression with instance-varying costs, where some instances
are much worse to be classified as positive (or negative) than other instances;
e.g., it is much worse to throw away a high-grade gold rock than a medium-grade
copper-ore rock, even if the mine wishes to keep both because both are
profitable. We show how to construct an impact curve for a variety of domains,
including examples from healthcare, mining, and entertainment. Impact curves
optimize binary decisions across all utilities of the chosen utility function,
identify the conditions where one model may be favoured over another, and
quantitatively assess improvement between competing models.

    <title>condLSTM-Q: A novel deep learning model for predicting Covid-19
  mortality in fine geographical Scale</title>
    <summary>  Predictive models with a focus on different spatial-temporal scales benefit
governments and healthcare systems to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we
present the conditional Long Short-Term Memory networks with Quantile output
(condLSTM-Q), a well-performing model for making quantile predictions on
COVID-19 death tolls at the county level with a two-week forecast window. This
fine geographical scale is a rare but useful feature in publicly available
predictive models, which would especially benefit state-level officials to
coordinate resources within the state. The quantile predictions from condLSTM-Q
inform people about the distribution of the predicted death tolls, allowing
better evaluation of possible trajectories of the severity. Given the
scalability and generalizability of neural network models, this model could
incorporate additional data sources with ease, and could be further developed
to generate other useful predictions such as new cases or hospitalizations
intuitively.

    <title>Encoding Domain Information with Sparse Priors for Inferring Explainable
  Latent Variables</title>
    <summary>  Latent variable models are powerful statistical tools that can uncover
relevant variation between patients or cells, by inferring unobserved hidden
states from observable high-dimensional data. A major shortcoming of current
methods, however, is their inability to learn sparse and interpretable hidden
states. Additionally, in settings where partial knowledge on the latent
structure of the data is readily available, a statistically sound integration
of prior information into current methods is challenging. To address these
issues, we propose spex-LVM, a factorial latent variable model with sparse
priors to encourage the inference of explainable factors driven by
domain-relevant information. spex-LVM utilizes existing knowledge of curated
biomedical pathways to automatically assign annotated attributes to latent
factors, yielding interpretable results tailored to the corresponding domain of
interest. Evaluations on simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets
demonstrate that our model robustly identifies relevant structure in an
inherently explainable manner, distinguishes technical noise from sources of
biomedical variation, and provides dataset-specific adaptations of existing
pathway annotations. Implementation is available at

    <title>Digital Twin approach to Clinical DSS with Explainable AI</title>
    <summary>  We propose a digital twin approach to improve healthcare decision support
systems with a combination of domain knowledge and data. Domain knowledge helps
build decision thresholds that doctors can use to determine a risk or recommend
a treatment or test based on the specific patient condition. However, these
assessments tend to be highly subjective and differ from doctor to doctor and
from patient to patient. We propose a system where we collate this subjective
risk by compiling data from different doctors treating different patients and
build a machine learning model that learns from this knowledge. Then using
state-of-the-art explainability concepts we derive explanations from this
model. These explanations give us a summary of different doctor domain
knowledge applied in different cases to give a more generic perspective. Also
these explanations are specific to a particular patient and are customized for
their condition. This is a form of a digital twin for the patient that can now
be used to enhance decision boundaries for earlier defined decision tables that
help in diagnosis. We will show an example of running this analysis for a liver
disease risk diagnosis.

    <title>Transformer Hawkes Process</title>
    <summary>  Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence
data in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial
markets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal
dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network based
point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable
prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes
Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture
long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical
experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in
terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin.
Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural
knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved
prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating
their relational information.

    <title>BScNets: Block Simplicial Complex Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Simplicial neural networks (SNN) have recently emerged as the newest
direction in graph learning which expands the idea of convolutional
architectures from node space to simplicial complexes on graphs. Instead of
pre-dominantly assessing pairwise relations among nodes as in the current
practice, simplicial complexes allow us to describe higher-order interactions
and multi-node graph structures. By building upon connection between the
convolution operation and the new block Hodge-Laplacian, we propose the first
SNN for link prediction. Our new Block Simplicial Complex Neural Networks
(BScNets) model generalizes the existing graph convolutional network (GCN)
frameworks by systematically incorporating salient interactions among multiple
higher-order graph structures of different dimensions. We discuss theoretical
foundations behind BScNets and illustrate its utility for link prediction on
eight real-world and synthetic datasets. Our experiments indicate that BScNets
outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin while
maintaining low computation costs. Finally, we show utility of BScNets as the
new promising alternative for tracking spread of infectious diseases such as
COVID-19 and measuring the effectiveness of the healthcare risk mitigation
strategies.

    <title>Optimal discharge of patients from intensive care via a data-driven
  policy learning framework</title>
    <summary>  Clinical decision support tools rooted in machine learning and optimization
can provide significant value to healthcare providers, including through better
management of intensive care units. In particular, it is important that the
patient discharge task addresses the nuanced trade-off between decreasing a
patient's length of stay (and associated hospitalization costs) and the risk of
readmission or even death following the discharge decision. This work
introduces an end-to-end general framework for capturing this trade-off to
recommend optimal discharge timing decisions given a patient's electronic
health records. A data-driven approach is used to derive a parsimonious,
discrete state space representation that captures a patient's physiological
condition. Based on this model and a given cost function, an infinite-horizon
discounted Markov decision process is formulated and solved numerically to
compute an optimal discharge policy, whose value is assessed using off-policy
evaluation strategies. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to
validate the proposed framework using real-life intensive care unit patient
data.

    <title>Taking a Step Back with KCal: Multi-Class Kernel-Based Calibration for
  Deep Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are often overconfident, producing
miscalibrated class probabilities. In high-risk applications like healthcare,
practitioners require $\textit{fully calibrated}$ probability predictions for
decision-making. That is, conditioned on the prediction $\textit{vector}$,
$\textit{every}$ class' probability should be close to the predicted value.
Most existing calibration methods either lack theoretical guarantees for
producing calibrated outputs, reduce classification accuracy in the process, or
only calibrate the predicted class. This paper proposes a new Kernel-based
calibration method called KCal. Unlike existing calibration procedures, KCal
does not operate directly on the logits or softmax outputs of the DNN. Instead,
KCal learns a metric space on the penultimate-layer latent embedding and
generates predictions using kernel density estimates on a calibration set. We
first analyze KCal theoretically, showing that it enjoys a provable
$\textit{full}$ calibration guarantee. Then, through extensive experiments
across a variety of datasets, we show that KCal consistently outperforms
baselines as measured by the calibration error and by proper scoring rules like
the Brier Score.

    <title>Bayesian Neural Networks with Domain Knowledge Priors</title>
    <summary>  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently gained popularity due to their
ability to quantify model uncertainty. However, specifying a prior for BNNs
that captures relevant domain knowledge is often extremely challenging. In this
work, we propose a framework for integrating general forms of domain knowledge
(i.e., any knowledge that can be represented by a loss function) into a BNN
prior through variational inference, while enabling computationally efficient
posterior inference and sampling. Specifically, our approach results in a prior
over neural network weights that assigns high probability mass to models that
better align with our domain knowledge, leading to posterior samples that also
exhibit this behavior. We show that BNNs using our proposed domain knowledge
priors outperform those with standard priors (e.g., isotropic Gaussian,
Gaussian process), successfully incorporating diverse types of prior
information such as fairness, physics rules, and healthcare knowledge and
achieving better predictive performance. We also present techniques for
transferring the learned priors across different model architectures,
demonstrating their broad utility across various settings.

    <title>Injecting Undetectable Backdoors in Deep Learning and Language Models</title>
    <summary>  As ML models become increasingly complex and integral to high-stakes domains
such as finance and healthcare, they also become more susceptible to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. We investigate the threat posed by
undetectable backdoors in models developed by insidious external expert firms.
When such backdoors exist, they allow the designer of the model to sell
information to the users on how to carefully perturb the least significant bits
of their input to change the classification outcome to a favorable one. We
develop a general strategy to plant a backdoor to neural networks while
ensuring that even if the model's weights and architecture are accessible, the
existence of the backdoor is still undetectable. To achieve this, we utilize
techniques from cryptography such as cryptographic signatures and
indistinguishability obfuscation. We further introduce the notion of
undetectable backdoors to language models and extend our neural network
backdoor attacks to such models based on the existence of steganographic
functions.

    <title>FairFed: Enabling Group Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Training ML models which are fair across different demographic groups is of
critical importance due to the increased integration of ML in crucial
decision-making scenarios such as healthcare and recruitment. Federated
learning has been viewed as a promising solution for collaboratively training
machine learning models among multiple parties while maintaining the privacy of
their local data. However, federated learning also poses new challenges in
mitigating the potential bias against certain populations (e.g., demographic
groups), as this typically requires centralized access to the sensitive
information (e.g., race, gender) of each datapoint. Motivated by the importance
and challenges of group fairness in federated learning, in this work, we
propose FairFed, a novel algorithm for fairness-aware aggregation to enhance
group fairness in federated learning. Our proposed approach is server-side and
agnostic to the applied local debiasing thus allowing for flexible use of
different local debiasing methods across clients. We evaluate FairFed
empirically versus common baselines for fair ML and federated learning, and
demonstrate that it provides fairer models particularly under highly
heterogeneous data distributions across clients. We also demonstrate the
benefits of FairFed in scenarios involving naturally distributed real-life data
collected from different geographical locations or departments within an
organization.

    <title>ELMV: an Ensemble-Learning Approach for Analyzing Electrical Health
  Records with Significant Missing Values</title>
    <summary>  Many real-world Electronic Health Record (EHR) data contains a large
proportion of missing values. Leaving substantial portion of missing
information unaddressed usually causes significant bias, which leads to invalid
conclusion to be drawn. On the other hand, training a machine learning model
with a much smaller nearly-complete subset can drastically impact the
reliability and accuracy of model inference. Data imputation algorithms that
attempt to replace missing data with meaningful values inevitably increase the
variability of effect estimates with increased missingness, making it
unreliable for hypothesis validation. We propose a novel Ensemble-Learning for
Missing Value (ELMV) framework, which introduces an effective approach to
construct multiple subsets of the original EHR data with a much lower missing
rate, as well as mobilizing a dedicated support set for the ensemble learning
in the purpose of reducing the bias caused by substantial missing values. ELMV
has been evaluated on a real-world healthcare data for critical feature
identification as well as a batch of simulation data with different missing
rates for outcome prediction. On both experiments, ELMV clearly outperforms
conventional missing value imputation methods and ensemble learning models.

    <title>Get the Ball Rolling: Alerting Autonomous Robots When to Help to Close
  the Healthcare Loop</title>
    <summary>  To facilitate the advancement of research in healthcare robots without human
intervention or commands, we introduce the Autonomous Helping Challenge, along
with a crowd-sourcing large-scale dataset. The goal is to create healthcare
robots that possess the ability to determine when assistance is necessary,
generate useful sub-tasks to aid in planning, carry out these plans through a
physical robot, and receive feedback from the environment in order to generate
new tasks and continue the process. Besides the general challenge in open-ended
scenarios, Autonomous Helping focuses on three specific challenges: autonomous
task generation, the gap between the current scene and static commonsense, and
the gap between language instruction and the real world. Additionally, we
propose Helpy, a potential approach to close the healthcare loop in the
learning-free setting.

    <title>Brain Tumor classification and Segmentation using Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  Brain tumors are a complex and potentially life-threatening medical condition
that requires accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. In this paper, we
present a machine learning-based system designed to assist healthcare
professionals in the classification and diagnosis of brain tumors using MRI
images. Our system provides a secure login, where doctors can upload or take a
photo of MRI and our app can classify the model and segment the tumor,
providing the doctor with a folder of each patient's history, name, and
results. Our system can also add results or MRI to this folder, draw on the MRI
to send it to another doctor, and save important results in a saved page in the
app. Furthermore, our system can classify in less than 1 second and allow
doctors to chat with a community of brain tumor doctors.
  To achieve these objectives, our system uses a state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithm that has been trained on a large dataset of MRI images. The
algorithm can accurately classify different types of brain tumors and provide
doctors with detailed information on the size, location, and severity of the
tumor. Additionally, our system has several features to ensure its security and
privacy, including secure login and data encryption.
  We evaluated our system using a dataset of real-world MRI images and compared
its performance to other existing systems. Our results demonstrate that our
system is highly accurate, efficient, and easy to use. We believe that our
system has the potential to revolutionize the field of brain tumor diagnosis
and treatment and provide healthcare professionals with a powerful tool for
improving patient outcomes.

    <title>Disparate Censorship &amp; Undertesting: A Source of Label Bias in Clinical
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning (ML) models gain traction in clinical applications,
understanding the impact of clinician and societal biases on ML models is
increasingly important. While biases can arise in the labels used for model
training, the many sources from which these biases arise are not yet
well-studied. In this paper, we highlight disparate censorship (i.e.,
differences in testing rates across patient groups) as a source of label bias
that clinical ML models may amplify, potentially causing harm. Many patient
risk-stratification models are trained using the results of clinician-ordered
diagnostic and laboratory tests of labels. Patients without test results are
often assigned a negative label, which assumes that untested patients do not
experience the outcome. Since orders are affected by clinical and resource
considerations, testing may not be uniform in patient populations, giving rise
to disparate censorship. Disparate censorship in patients of equivalent risk
leads to undertesting in certain groups, and in turn, more biased labels for
such groups. Using such biased labels in standard ML pipelines could contribute
to gaps in model performance across patient groups. Here, we theoretically and
empirically characterize conditions in which disparate censorship or
undertesting affect model performance across subgroups. Our findings call
attention to disparate censorship as a source of label bias in clinical ML
models.

    <title>Towards dynamic multi-modal phenotyping using chest radiographs and
  physiological data</title>
    <summary>  The healthcare domain is characterized by heterogeneous data modalities, such
as imaging and physiological data. In practice, the variety of medical data
assists clinicians in decision-making. However, most of the current
state-of-the-art deep learning models solely rely upon carefully curated data
of a single modality. In this paper, we propose a dynamic training approach to
learn modality-specific data representations and to integrate auxiliary
features, instead of solely relying on a single modality. Our preliminary
experiments results for a patient phenotyping task using physiological data in
MIMIC-IV &amp; chest radiographs in the MIMIC- CXR dataset show that our proposed
approach achieves the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) (0.764 AUROC) compared to the performance of the benchmark method
in previous work, which only used physiological data (0.740 AUROC). For a set
of five recurring or chronic diseases with periodic acute episodes, including
cardiac dysrhythmia, conduction disorders, and congestive heart failure, the
AUROC improves from 0.747 to 0.798. This illustrates the benefit of leveraging
the chest imaging modality in the phenotyping task and highlights the potential
of multi-modal learning in medical applications.

    <title>Robustifying a Policy in Multi-Agent RL with Diverse Cooperative
  Behaviors and Adversarial Style Sampling for Assistive Tasks</title>
    <summary>  Autonomous assistance of people with motor impairments is one of the most
promising applications of autonomous robotic systems. Recent studies have
reported encouraging results using deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the
healthcare domain. Previous studies showed that assistive tasks can be
formulated as multi-agent RL, wherein there are two agents: a caregiver and a
care-receiver. However, policies trained in multi-agent RL are often sensitive
to the policies of other agents. In such a case, a trained caregiver's policy
may not work for different care-receivers. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a framework that learns a robust caregiver's policy by training it for diverse
care-receiver responses. In our framework, diverse care-receiver responses are
autonomously learned through trials and errors. In addition, to robustify the
care-giver's policy, we propose a strategy for sampling a care-receiver's
response in an adversarial manner during the training. We evaluated the
proposed method using tasks in an Assistive Gym. We demonstrate that policies
trained with a popular deep RL method are vulnerable to changes in policies of
other agents and that the proposed framework improves the robustness against
such changes.

    <title>Fair Representation Learning using Interpolation Enabled Disentanglement</title>
    <summary>  With the growing interest in the machine learning community to solve
real-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning
behind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions
made by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled
representations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for
downstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the
proposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we
propose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation
Enabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based
adversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space
to be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and
enhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction
tasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on
fairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual
information estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRIED on datasets
of different modalities - tabular, text, and image datasets. We observe that
the representations learned by FRIED are overall fairer in comparison to
existing baselines and also accurate for downstream prediction tasks.
Additionally, we evaluate FRIED on a real-world healthcare claims dataset where
we conduct an expert aided model auditing study providing useful insights into
opioid ad-diction patterns.

    <title>Learning Temporal Point Processes via Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Social goods, such as healthcare, smart city, and information networks, often
produce ordered event data in continuous time. The generative processes of
these event data can be very complex, requiring flexible models to capture
their dynamics. Temporal point processes offer an elegant framework for
modeling event data without discretizing the time. However, the existing
maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) learning paradigm requires hand-crafting
the intensity function beforehand and cannot directly monitor the
goodness-of-fit of the estimated model in the process of training. To alleviate
the risk of model-misspecification in MLE, we propose to generate samples from
the generative model and monitor the quality of the samples in the process of
training until the samples and the real data are indistinguishable. We take
inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) and treat the generation of each
event as the action taken by a stochastic policy. We parameterize the policy as
a flexible recurrent neural network and gradually improve the policy to mimic
the observed event distribution. Since the reward function is unknown in this
setting, we uncover an analytic and nonparametric form of the reward function
using an inverse reinforcement learning formulation. This new RL framework
allows us to derive an efficient policy gradient algorithm for learning
flexible point process models, and we show that it performs well in both
synthetic and real data.

    <title>Transfer Learning for Causal Effect Estimation</title>
    <summary>  We present a Transfer Causal Learning (TCL) framework when target and source
domains share the same covariate/feature spaces, aiming to improve causal
effect estimation accuracy in limited data. Limited data is very common in
medical applications, where some rare medical conditions, such as sepsis, are
of interest. Our proposed method, named \texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL}, incorporates
$\ell_1$ regularized TL for nuisance models (e.g., propensity score model); the
TL estimator of the nuisance parameters is plugged into downstream average
causal/treatment effect estimators (e.g., inverse probability weighted
estimator). We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the
\texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL} with generalized linear model (GLM) under the sparsity
assumption in the high-dimensional setting, and demonstrate the empirical
benefits of \texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL} through extensive numerical simulation for
GLM and recent neural network nuisance models. Our method is subsequently
extended to real data and generates meaningful insights consistent with medical
literature, a case where all baseline methods fail.

    <title>Histopathological Cancer Detection Using Hybrid Quantum Computing</title>
    <summary>  We present an effective application of quantum machine learning in the field
of healthcare. The study here emphasizes on a classification problem of a
histopathological cancer detection using quantum transfer learning. Rather than
using single transfer learning model, the work model presented here consists of
multiple transfer learning models especially ResNet18, VGG-16, Inception-v3,
AlexNet and several variational quantum circuits (VQC) with high
expressibility. As a result, we provide a comparative analysis of the models
and the best performing transfer learning model with the prediction AUC of
approximately 93 percent for histopathological cancer detection. We also
observed that for 1000 images with Resnet18, Hybrid Quantum and Classical (HQC)
provided a slightly better accuracy of 88.5 percent than classical of 88.0
percent.

    <title>Reinforcement Logic Rule Learning for Temporal Point Processes</title>
    <summary>  We propose a framework that can incrementally expand the explanatory temporal
logic rule set to explain the occurrence of temporal events. Leveraging the
temporal point process modeling and learning framework, the rule content and
weights will be gradually optimized until the likelihood of the observational
event sequences is optimal. The proposed algorithm alternates between a master
problem, where the current rule set weights are updated, and a subproblem,
where a new rule is searched and included to best increase the likelihood. The
formulated master problem is convex and relatively easy to solve using
continuous optimization, whereas the subproblem requires searching the huge
combinatorial rule predicate and relationship space. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a neural search policy to learn to generate the new rule content as
a sequence of actions. The policy parameters will be trained end-to-end using
the reinforcement learning framework, where the reward signals can be
efficiently queried by evaluating the subproblem objective. The trained policy
can be used to generate new rules in a controllable way. We evaluate our
methods on both synthetic and real healthcare datasets, obtaining promising
results.

    <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Deep Learning Methods for
  Electrocardiogram Data: A Systematic Review</title>
    <summary>  Background:The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used
diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. Deep learning methods have
achieved promising results on predictive healthcare tasks using ECG signals.
Objective:This paper presents a systematic review of deep learning methods for
ECG data from both modeling and application perspectives. Methods:We extracted
papers that applied deep learning (deep neural network) models to ECG data that
were published between Jan. 1st of 2010 and Feb. 29th of 2020 from Google
Scholar, PubMed, and the DBLP. We then analyzed each article according to three
factors: tasks, models, and data. Finally, we discuss open challenges and
unsolved problems in this area. Results: The total number of papers extracted
was 191. Among these papers, 108 were published after 2019. Different deep
learning architectures have been used in various ECG analytics tasks, such as
disease detection/classification, annotation/localization, sleep staging,
biometric human identification, and denoising. Conclusion: The number of works
on deep learning for ECG data has grown explosively in recent years. Such works
have achieved accuracy comparable to that of traditional feature-based
approaches and ensembles of multiple approaches can achieve even better
results. Specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional
neural network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features
yields the best results. However, there are some new challenges and problems
related to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency that must be
addressed. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from
the perspectives of datasets and methods. Significance: This paper summarizes
existing deep learning research using ECG data from multiple perspectives and
highlights existing challenges and problems to identify potential future
research directions.

    <title>Mitochondria-based Renal Cell Carcinoma Subtyping: Learning from Deep
  vs. Flat Feature Representations</title>
    <summary>  Accurate subtyping of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is of crucial importance for
understanding disease progression and for making informed treatment decisions.
New discoveries of significant alterations to mitochondria between subtypes
make immunohistochemical (IHC) staining based image classification an
imperative. Until now, accurate quantification and subtyping was made
impossible by huge IHC variations, the absence of cell membrane staining for
cytoplasm segmentation as well as the complete lack of systems for robust and
reproducible image based classification. In this paper we present a
comprehensive classification framework to overcome these challenges for tissue
microarrays (TMA) of RCCs. We compare and evaluate models based on domain
specific hand-crafted "flat"-features versus "deep" feature representations
from various layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The
best model reaches a cross-validation accuracy of 89%, which demonstrates for
the first time, that robust mitochondria-based subtyping of renal cancer is
feasible

    <title>Using Causal Analysis for Conceptual Deep Learning Explanation</title>
    <summary>  Model explainability is essential for the creation of trustworthy Machine
Learning models in healthcare. An ideal explanation resembles the
decision-making process of a domain expert and is expressed using concepts or
terminology that is meaningful to the clinicians. To provide such an
explanation, we first associate the hidden units of the classifier to
clinically relevant concepts. We take advantage of radiology reports
accompanying the chest X-ray images to define concepts. We discover sparse
associations between concepts and hidden units using a linear sparse logistic
regression. To ensure that the identified units truly influence the
classifier's outcome, we adopt tools from Causal Inference literature and, more
specifically, mediation analysis through counterfactual interventions. Finally,
we construct a low-depth decision tree to translate all the discovered concepts
into a straightforward decision rule, expressed to the radiologist. We
evaluated our approach on a large chest x-ray dataset, where our model produces
a global explanation consistent with clinical knowledge.

    <title>Diversity-Inducing Policy Gradient: Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy to
  Find a Set of Diverse Policies</title>
    <summary>  Standard reinforcement learning methods aim to master one way of solving a
task whereas there may exist multiple near-optimal policies. Being able to
identify this collection of near-optimal policies can allow a domain expert to
efficiently explore the space of reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, existing
approaches that quantify uncertainty over policies are not ultimately relevant
to finding policies with qualitatively distinct behaviors. In this work, we
formalize the difference between policies as a difference between the
distribution of trajectories induced by each policy, which encourages diversity
with respect to both state visitation and action choices. We derive a
gradient-based optimization technique that can be combined with existing policy
gradient methods to now identify diverse collections of well-performing
policies. We demonstrate our approach on benchmarks and a healthcare task.

    <title>Enhancing Mortality Prediction in Heart Failure Patients: Exploring
  Preprocessing Methods for Imbalanced Clinical Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Heart failure (HF) is a critical condition in which the accurate prediction
of mortality plays a vital role in guiding patient management decisions.
However, clinical datasets used for mortality prediction in HF often suffer
from an imbalanced distribution of classes, posing significant challenges. In
this paper, we explore preprocessing methods for enhancing one-month mortality
prediction in HF patients. We present a comprehensive preprocessing framework
including scaling, outliers processing and resampling as key techniques. We
also employed an aware encoding approach to effectively handle missing values
in clinical datasets. Our study utilizes a comprehensive dataset from the
Persian Registry Of cardio Vascular disease (PROVE) with a significant class
imbalance. By leveraging appropriate preprocessing techniques and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms, we aim to improve mortality prediction performance
for HF patients. The results reveal an average enhancement of approximately
3.6% in F1 score and 2.7% in MCC for tree-based models, specifically Random
Forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). This demonstrates the efficiency of our
preprocessing approach in effectively handling Imbalanced Clinical Datasets
(ICD). Our findings hold promise in guiding healthcare professionals to make
informed decisions and improve patient outcomes in HF management.

    <summary>  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, and
early detection can significantly improve outcomes for patients. Machine
learning (ML) models can help diagnose CVDs early, but their performance is
limited by the data available for model training. Privacy concerns in
healthcare make it harder to acquire data to train accurate ML models.
Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach to machine learning that allows
models to be trained on data from multiple sources without compromising the
privacy of the individual data owners. This survey paper provides an overview
of the current state-of-the-art in FL for CVD detection. We review the
different FL models proposed in various papers and discuss their advantages and
challenges. We also compare FL with traditional centralized learning approaches
and highlight the differences in terms of model accuracy, privacy, and data
distribution handling capacity. Finally, we provide a critical analysis of FL's
current challenges and limitations for CVD detection and discuss potential
avenues for future research. Overall, this survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in FL for CVD detection
and to highlight its potential for improving the accuracy and privacy of CVD
detection models.

    <title>Who Gets the Job and How are They Paid? Machine Learning Application on
  H-1B Case Data</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to explore the H-1B
application dataset disclosed by the Department of Labor (DOL), from 2008 to
2018, in order to provide more stylized facts of the international workers in
US labor market. We train a LASSO Regression model to analyze the impact of
different features on the applicant's wage, and a Logistic Regression with
L1-Penalty as a classifier to study the feature's impact on the likelihood of
the case being certified. Our analysis shows that working in the healthcare
industry, working in California, higher job level contribute to higher
salaries. In the meantime, lower job level, working in the education services
industry and nationality of Philippines are negatively correlated with the
salaries. In terms of application status, a Ph.D. degree, working in retail or
finance, majoring in computer science will give the applicants a better chance
of being certified. Applicants with no or an associate degree, working in the
education services industry, or majoring in education are more likely to be
rejected.

    <title>Offline Policy Optimization with Eligible Actions</title>
    <summary>  Offline policy optimization could have a large impact on many real-world
decision-making problems, as online learning may be infeasible in many
applications. Importance sampling and its variants are a commonly used type of
estimator in offline policy evaluation, and such estimators typically do not
require assumptions on the properties and representational capabilities of
value function or decision process model function classes. In this paper, we
identify an important overfitting phenomenon in optimizing the importance
weighted return, in which it may be possible for the learned policy to
essentially avoid making aligned decisions for part of the initial state space.
We propose an algorithm to avoid this overfitting through a new
per-state-neighborhood normalization constraint, and provide a theoretical
justification of the proposed algorithm. We also show the limitations of
previous attempts to this approach. We test our algorithm in a
healthcare-inspired simulator, a logged dataset collected from real hospitals
and continuous control tasks. These experiments show the proposed method yields
less overfitting and better test performance compared to state-of-the-art batch
reinforcement learning algorithms.

    <title>FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend
  Against Poisoning Attacks</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) is revolutionizing how we learn from data. With its
growing popularity, it is now being used in many safety-critical domains such
as autonomous vehicles and healthcare. Since thousands of participants can
contribute in this collaborative setting, it is, however, challenging to ensure
security and reliability of such systems. This highlights the need to design FL
systems that are secure and robust against malicious participants' actions
while also ensuring high utility, privacy of local data, and efficiency. In
this paper, we propose a novel FL framework dubbed as FLShield that utilizes
benign data from FL participants to validate the local models before taking
them into account for generating the global model. This is in stark contrast
with existing defenses relying on server's access to clean datasets -- an
assumption often impractical in real-life scenarios and conflicting with the
fundamentals of FL. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our FLShield
framework in different settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in thwarting
various types of poisoning and backdoor attacks including a defense-aware one.
FLShield also preserves privacy of local data against gradient inversion
attacks.

    <title>Towards Continual Reinforcement Learning: A Review and Perspectives</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we aim to provide a literature review of different
formulations and approaches to continual reinforcement learning (RL), also
known as lifelong or non-stationary RL. We begin by discussing our perspective
on why RL is a natural fit for studying continual learning. We then provide a
taxonomy of different continual RL formulations by mathematically
characterizing two key properties of non-stationarity, namely, the scope and
driver non-stationarity. This offers a unified view of various formulations.
Next, we review and present a taxonomy of continual RL approaches. We go on to
discuss evaluation of continual RL agents, providing an overview of benchmarks
used in the literature and important metrics for understanding agent
performance. Finally, we highlight open problems and challenges in bridging the
gap between the current state of continual RL and findings in neuroscience.
While still in its early days, the study of continual RL has the promise to
develop better incremental reinforcement learners that can function in
increasingly realistic applications where non-stationarity plays a vital role.
These include applications such as those in the fields of healthcare,
education, logistics, and robotics.

    <title>IIDS: Design of Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for
  Internet-of-Things Applications</title>
    <summary>  With rapid technological growth, security attacks are drastically increasing.
In many crucial Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications such as healthcare and
defense, the early detection of security attacks plays a significant role in
protecting huge resources. An intrusion detection system is used to address
this problem. The signature-based approaches fail to detect zero-day attacks.
So anomaly-based detection particularly AI tools, are becoming popular. In
addition, the imbalanced dataset leads to biased results. In Machine Learning
(ML) models, F1 score is an important metric to measure the accuracy of
class-level correct predictions. The model may fail to detect the target
samples if the F1 is considerably low. It will lead to unrecoverable
consequences in sensitive applications such as healthcare and defense. So, any
improvement in the F1 score has significant impact on the resource protection.
In this paper, we present a framework for ML-based intrusion detection system
for an imbalanced dataset. In this study, the most recent dataset, namely
CICIoT2023 is considered. The random forest (RF) algorithm is used in the
proposed framework. The proposed approach improves 3.72%, 3.75% and 4.69% in
precision, recall and F1 score, respectively, with the existing method.
Additionally, for unsaturated classes (i.e., classes with F1 score &lt; 0.99), F1
score improved significantly by 7.9%. As a result, the proposed approach is
more suitable for IoT security applications for efficient detection of
intrusion and is useful in further studies.

    <title>Generalization Bounds and Representation Learning for Estimation of
  Potential Outcomes and Causal Effects</title>
    <summary>  Practitioners in diverse fields such as healthcare, economics and education
are eager to apply machine learning to improve decision making. The cost and
impracticality of performing experiments and a recent monumental increase in
electronic record keeping has brought attention to the problem of evaluating
decisions based on non-experimental observational data. This is the setting of
this work. In particular, we study estimation of individual-level causal
effects, such as a single patient's response to alternative medication, from
recorded contexts, decisions and outcomes. We give generalization bounds on the
error in estimated effects based on distance measures between groups receiving
different treatments, allowing for sample re-weighting. We provide conditions
under which our bound is tight and show how it relates to results for
unsupervised domain adaptation. Led by our theoretical results, we devise
representation learning algorithms that minimize our bound, by regularizing the
representation's induced treatment group distance, and encourage sharing of
information between treatment groups. We extend these algorithms to
simultaneously learn a weighted representation to further reduce treatment
group distances. Finally, an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data
shows the value of our proposed representation architecture and regularization
scheme.

    <title>Eye Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning and Attention on OCT
  Scans</title>
    <summary>  Eye diseases have posed significant challenges for decades, but advancements
in technology have opened new avenues for their detection and treatment.
Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in this
domain, particularly when combined with Optical Coherent Technology (OCT)
imaging. We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from
OCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease
free (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal
Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this
work, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning
and deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The
application allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which
undergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images
are then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception
networks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach
leverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved
classification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict
and classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization
have been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal
performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds
significant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby
contributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes.

    <title>Evaluating Model Robustness and Stability to Dataset Shift</title>
    <summary>  As the use of machine learning in high impact domains becomes widespread, the
importance of evaluating safety has increased. An important aspect of this is
evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which
typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since
the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we
propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available
data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under
which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm's performance
on the "worst-case" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined
conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping
other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare
context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping
the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with
estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a "debiased"
estimator which maintains $\sqrt{N}$-consistency even when machine learning
methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance
parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this
estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts
that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows
practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without
requiring additional data collection.

    <title>A(DP)$^2$SGD: Asynchronous Decentralized Parallel Stochastic Gradient
  Descent with Differential Privacy</title>
    <summary>  As deep learning models are usually massive and complex, distributed learning
is essential for increasing training efficiency. Moreover, in many real-world
application scenarios like healthcare, distributed learning can also keep the
data local and protect privacy. A popular distributed learning strategy is
federated learning, where there is a central server storing the global model
and a set of local computing nodes updating the model parameters with their
corresponding data. The updated model parameters will be processed and
transmitted to the central server, which leads to heavy communication costs.
Recently, asynchronous decentralized distributed learning has been proposed and
demonstrated to be a more efficient and practical strategy where there is no
central server, so that each computing node only communicates with its
neighbors. Although no raw data will be transmitted across different local
nodes, there is still a risk of information leak during the communication
process for malicious participants to make attacks. In this paper, we present a
differentially private version of asynchronous decentralized parallel SGD
(ADPSGD) framework, or A(DP)$^2$SGD for short, which maintains communication
efficiency of ADPSGD and prevents the inference from malicious participants.
Specifically, R{\'e}nyi differential privacy is used to provide tighter privacy
analysis for our composite Gaussian mechanisms while the convergence rate is
consistent with the non-private version. Theoretical analysis shows
A(DP)$^2$SGD also converges at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate as
SGD. Empirically, A(DP)$^2$SGD achieves comparable model accuracy as the
differentially private version of Synchronous SGD (SSGD) but runs much faster
than SSGD in heterogeneous computing environments.

    <title>Diagnosing failures of fairness transfer across distribution shift in
  real-world medical settings</title>
    <summary>  Diagnosing and mitigating changes in model fairness under distribution shift
is an important component of the safe deployment of machine learning in
healthcare settings. Importantly, the success of any mitigation strategy
strongly depends on the structure of the shift. Despite this, there has been
little discussion of how to empirically assess the structure of a distribution
shift that one is encountering in practice. In this work, we adopt a causal
framing to motivate conditional independence tests as a key tool for
characterizing distribution shifts. Using our approach in two medical
applications, we show that this knowledge can help diagnose failures of
fairness transfer, including cases where real-world shifts are more complex
than is often assumed in the literature. Based on these results, we discuss
potential remedies at each step of the machine learning pipeline.

    <title>Appointment scheduling model in healthcare using clustering algorithms</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we provided a scheduling procedure which is a combination of
machine learning and mathematical programming that minimizes the waiting time
of higher priority outpatients. Outpatients who request for appointment in
healthcare facilities have different priorities. Determining the priority of
outpatients and allocating the capacity based on the priority classes are
important concepts that have to be considered in the scheduling of outpatients.
In this study, two stages are defined for scheduling an incoming outpatient. In
the initial stage, we employed and evaluated four distinct clustering
techniques; K-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN,
and OPTICS clustering to classify outpatients into priority classes and
suggested the best pattern to cluster the outpatients. In the second stage, we
modeled the scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem since
the arrivals are uncertain and the decisions are taken at the end of each day
after observing total requests. Due to the curse of dimensionality, we used the
fluid approximation method to estimate the optimal solution of the MDP. our
methodology is employed in a data set of Shaheed Rajaei Medical and Research
Center, and we represented how our model works in prioritizing and scheduling
outpatients.

    <title>Does Synthetic Data Generation of LLMs Help Clinical Text Mining?</title>
    <summary>  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
development of highly potent models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These models have
exhibited exceptional performance in a variety of tasks, such as question
answering, essay composition, and code generation. However, their effectiveness
in the healthcare sector remains uncertain. In this study, we seek to
investigate the potential of ChatGPT to aid in clinical text mining by
examining its ability to extract structured information from unstructured
healthcare texts, with a focus on biological named entity recognition and
relation extraction. However, our preliminary results indicate that employing
ChatGPT directly for these tasks resulted in poor performance and raised
privacy concerns associated with uploading patients' information to the ChatGPT
API. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new training paradigm that
involves generating a vast quantity of high-quality synthetic data with labels
utilizing ChatGPT and fine-tuning a local model for the downstream task. Our
method has resulted in significant improvements in the performance of
downstream tasks, improving the F1-score from 23.37% to 63.99% for the named
entity recognition task and from 75.86% to 83.59% for the relation extraction
task. Furthermore, generating data using ChatGPT can significantly reduce the
time and effort required for data collection and labeling, as well as mitigate
data privacy concerns. In summary, the proposed framework presents a promising
solution to enhance the applicability of LLM models to clinical text mining.

    <title>Multi-Modal Perceiver Language Model for Outcome Prediction in Emergency
  Department</title>
    <summary>  Language modeling have shown impressive progress in generating compelling
text with good accuracy and high semantic coherence. An interesting research
direction is to augment these powerful models for specific applications using
contextual information. In this work, we explore multi-modal language modeling
for healthcare applications. We are interested in outcome prediction and
patient triage in hospital emergency department based on text information in
chief complaints and vital signs recorded at triage. We adapt Perceiver - a
modality-agnostic transformer-based model that has shown promising results in
several applications. Since vital-sign modality is represented in tabular
format, we modified Perceiver position encoding to ensure permutation
invariance. We evaluated the multi-modal language model for the task of
diagnosis code prediction using MIMIC-IV ED dataset on 120K visits. In the
experimental analysis, we show that mutli-modality improves the prediction
performance compared with models trained solely on text or vital signs. We
identified disease categories for which multi-modality leads to performance
improvement and show that for these categories, vital signs have added
predictive power. By analyzing the cross-attention layer, we show how
multi-modality contributes to model predictions. This work gives interesting
insights on the development of multi-modal language models for healthcare
applications.

    <title>Dataset Optimization for Chronic Disease Prediction with Bio-Inspired
  Feature Selection</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we investigated the application of bio-inspired optimization
algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Whale
Optimization Algorithm, for feature selection in chronic disease prediction.
The primary goal was to enhance the predictive accuracy of models streamline
data dimensionality, and make predictions more interpretable and actionable.
  The research encompassed a comparative analysis of the three bio-inspired
feature selection approaches across diverse chronic diseases, including
diabetes, cancer, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases. Performance metrics such
as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score are used to assess the
effectiveness of the algorithms in reducing the number of features needed for
accurate classification.
  The results in general demonstrate that the bio-inspired optimization
algorithms are effective in reducing the number of features required for
accurate classification. However, there have been variations in the performance
of the algorithms on different datasets.
  The study highlights the importance of data pre-processing and cleaning in
ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the analysis.
  This study contributes to the advancement of predictive analytics in the
realm of chronic diseases. The potential impact of this work extends to early
intervention, precision medicine, and improved patient outcomes, providing new
avenues for the delivery of healthcare services tailored to individual needs.
The findings underscore the potential benefits of using bio-inspired
optimization algorithms for feature selection in chronic disease prediction,
offering valuable insights for improving healthcare outcomes.

    <title>SubTab: Subsetting Features of Tabular Data for Self-Supervised
  Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised learning has been shown to be very effective in learning
useful representations, and yet much of the success is achieved in data types
such as images, audio, and text. The success is mainly enabled by taking
advantage of spatial, temporal, or semantic structure in the data through
augmentation. However, such structure may not exist in tabular datasets
commonly used in fields such as healthcare, making it difficult to design an
effective augmentation method, and hindering a similar progress in tabular data
setting. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, Subsetting features of
Tabular data (SubTab), that turns the task of learning from tabular data into a
multi-view representation learning problem by dividing the input features to
multiple subsets. We argue that reconstructing the data from the subset of its
features rather than its corrupted version in an autoencoder setting can better
capture its underlying latent representation. In this framework, the joint
representation can be expressed as the aggregate of latent variables of the
subsets at test time, which we refer to as collaborative inference. Our
experiments show that the SubTab achieves the state of the art (SOTA)
performance of 98.31% on MNIST in tabular setting, on par with CNN-based SOTA
models, and surpasses existing baselines on three other real-world datasets by
a significant margin.

    <title>Dissonance Between Human and Machine Understanding</title>
    <summary>  Complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains
including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional
black boxes. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting
decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans.
Models that correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in
certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases
and in turn build better models. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how
and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. In this paper, we
present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the
dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an
image classification task. In particular, we seek to answer the following
questions: Which (well-performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in
their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty
affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans?
Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image
recognition more accurate? Our findings have important implications on
human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of
artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning
like humans.

    <title>Generalization in Healthcare AI: Evaluation of a Clinical Large Language
  Model</title>
    <summary>  Advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities in
healthcare for improved patient care, clinical decision-making, and enhancement
of physician and administrator workflows. However, the potential of these
models importantly depends on their ability to generalize effectively across
clinical environments and populations, a challenge often underestimated in
early development. To better understand reasons for these challenges and inform
mitigation approaches, we evaluated ClinicLLM, an LLM trained on [HOSPITAL]'s
clinical notes, analyzing its performance on 30-day all-cause readmission
prediction focusing on variability across hospitals and patient
characteristics. We found poorer generalization particularly in hospitals with
fewer samples, among patients with government and unspecified insurance, the
elderly, and those with high comorbidities. To understand reasons for lack of
generalization, we investigated sample sizes for fine-tuning, note content
(number of words per note), patient characteristics (comorbidity level, age,
insurance type, borough), and health system aspects (hospital, all-cause 30-day
readmission, and mortality rates). We used descriptive statistics and
supervised classification to identify features. We found that, along with
sample size, patient age, number of comorbidities, and the number of words in
notes are all important factors related to generalization. Finally, we compared
local fine-tuning (hospital specific), instance-based augmented fine-tuning and
cluster-based fine-tuning for improving generalization. Among these, local
fine-tuning proved most effective, increasing AUC by 0.25% to 11.74% (most
helpful in settings with limited data). Overall, this study provides new
insights for enhancing the deployment of large language models in the
societally important domain of healthcare, and improving their performance for
broader populations.

    <title>Google Translate Error Analysis for Mental Healthcare Information:
  Evaluating Accuracy, Comprehensibility, and Implications for Multilingual
  Healthcare Communication</title>
    <summary>  This study explores the use of Google Translate (GT) for translating mental
healthcare (MHealth) information and evaluates its accuracy, comprehensibility,
and implications for multilingual healthcare communication through analysing GT
output in the MHealth domain from English to Persian, Arabic, Turkish,
Romanian, and Spanish. Two datasets comprising MHealth information from the UK
National Health Service website and information leaflets from The Royal College
of Psychiatrists were used. Native speakers of the target languages manually
assessed the GT translations, focusing on medical terminology accuracy,
comprehensibility, and critical syntactic/semantic errors. GT output analysis
revealed challenges in accurately translating medical terminology, particularly
in Arabic, Romanian, and Persian. Fluency issues were prevalent across various
languages, affecting comprehension, mainly in Arabic and Spanish. Critical
errors arose in specific contexts, such as bullet-point formatting,
specifically in Persian, Turkish, and Romanian. Although improvements are seen
in longer-text translations, there remains a need to enhance accuracy in
medical and mental health terminology and fluency, whilst also addressing
formatting issues for a more seamless user experience. The findings highlight
the need to use customised translation engines for Mhealth translation and the
challenges when relying solely on machine-translated medical content,
emphasising the crucial role of human reviewers in multilingual healthcare
communication.

    <title>Federated Graph Learning -- A Position Paper</title>
    <summary>  Graph neural networks (GNN) have been successful in many fields, and derived
various researches and applications in real industries. However, in some
privacy sensitive scenarios (like finance, healthcare), training a GNN model
centrally faces challenges due to the distributed data silos. Federated
learning (FL) is a an emerging technique that can collaboratively train a
shared model while keeping the data decentralized, which is a rational solution
for distributed GNN training. We term it as federated graph learning (FGL).
Although FGL has received increasing attention recently, the definition and
challenges of FGL is still up in the air. In this position paper, we present a
categorization to clarify it. Considering how graph data are distributed among
clients, we propose four types of FGL: inter-graph FL, intra-graph FL and
graph-structured FL, where intra-graph is further divided into horizontal and
vertical FGL. For each type of FGL, we make a detailed discussion about the
formulation and applications, and propose some potential challenges.

    <title>Self-Adaptive Forecasting for Improved Deep Learning on Non-Stationary
  Time-Series</title>
    <summary>  Real-world time-series datasets often violate the assumptions of standard
supervised learning for forecasting -- their distributions evolve over time,
rendering the conventional training and model selection procedures suboptimal.
In this paper, we propose a novel method, Self-Adaptive Forecasting (SAF), to
modify the training of time-series forecasting models to improve their
performance on forecasting tasks with such non-stationary time-series data. SAF
integrates a self-adaptation stage prior to forecasting based on `backcasting',
i.e. predicting masked inputs backward in time. This is a form of test-time
training that creates a self-supervised learning problem on test samples before
performing the prediction task. In this way, our method enables efficient
adaptation of encoded representations to evolving distributions, leading to
superior generalization. SAF can be integrated with any canonical
encoder-decoder based time-series architecture such as recurrent neural
networks or attention-based architectures. On synthetic and real-world datasets
in domains where time-series data are known to be notoriously non-stationary,
such as healthcare and finance, we demonstrate a significant benefit of SAF in
improving forecasting accuracy.

    <title>Scale Federated Learning for Label Set Mismatch in Medical Image
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to the healthcare domain as a
decentralized learning paradigm that allows multiple parties to train a model
collaboratively without privacy leakage. However, most previous studies have
assumed that every client holds an identical label set. In reality, medical
specialists tend to annotate only diseases within their area of expertise or
interest. This implies that label sets in each client can be different and even
disjoint. In this paper, we propose the framework FedLSM to solve the problem
of Label Set Mismatch. FedLSM adopts different training strategies on data with
different uncertainty levels to efficiently utilize unlabeled or partially
labeled data as well as class-wise adaptive aggregation in the classification
layer to avoid inaccurate aggregation when clients have missing labels. We
evaluated FedLSM on two public real-world medical image datasets, including
chest X-ray (CXR) diagnosis with 112,120 CXR images and skin lesion diagnosis
with 10,015 dermoscopy images, and showed that it significantly outperformed
other state-of-the-art FL algorithms. The code can be found at

    <title>Interpretation of immunofluorescence slides by deep learning techniques:
  anti-nuclear antibodies case study</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, diseases are increasing in numbers and severity by the hour.
Immunity diseases, affecting 8\% of the world population in 2017 according to
the World Health Organization (WHO), is a field in medicine worth attention due
to the high rate of disease occurrence classified under this category. This
work presents an up-to-date review of state-of-the-art immune diseases
healthcare solutions. We focus on tackling the issue with modern solutions such
as Deep Learning to detect anomalies in the early stages hence providing health
practitioners with efficient tools. We rely on advanced deep learning
techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to fulfill our objective
of providing an efficient tool while providing a proficient analysis of this
solution. The proposed solution was tested and evaluated by the immunology
department in the Principal Military Hospital of Instruction of Tunis, which
considered it a very helpful tool.

    <title>Evaluating Fairness in Self-supervised and Supervised Models for
  Sequential Data</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become the de facto training paradigm of
large models where pre-training is followed by supervised fine-tuning using
domain-specific data and labels. Hypothesizing that SSL models would learn more
generic, hence less biased, representations, this study explores the impact of
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies on fairness (i.e., performing equally
on different demographic breakdowns). Motivated by human-centric applications
on real-world timeseries data, we interpret inductive biases on the model,
layer, and metric levels by systematically comparing SSL models to their
supervised counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that SSL has the capacity to
achieve performance on par with supervised methods while significantly
enhancing fairness--exhibiting up to a 27% increase in fairness with a mere 1%
loss in performance through self-supervision. Ultimately, this work underscores
SSL's potential in human-centric computing, particularly high-stakes,
data-scarce application domains like healthcare.

    <title>Transductive Reward Inference on Graph</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we present a transductive inference approach on that reward
information propagation graph, which enables the effective estimation of
rewards for unlabelled data in offline reinforcement learning. Reward inference
is the key to learning effective policies in practical scenarios, while direct
environmental interactions are either too costly or unethical and the reward
functions are rarely accessible, such as in healthcare and robotics. Our
research focuses on developing a reward inference method based on the
contextual properties of information propagation on graphs that capitalizes on
a constrained number of human reward annotations to infer rewards for
unlabelled data. We leverage both the available data and limited reward
annotations to construct a reward propagation graph, wherein the edge weights
incorporate various influential factors pertaining to the rewards.
Subsequently, we employ the constructed graph for transductive reward
inference, thereby estimating rewards for unlabelled data. Furthermore, we
establish the existence of a fixed point during several iterations of the
transductive inference process and demonstrate its at least convergence to a
local optimum. Empirical evaluations on locomotion and robotic manipulation
tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The application of our
inferred rewards improves the performance in offline reinforcement learning
tasks.

    <title>Anomaly Detection by Context Contrasting</title>
    <summary>  Anomaly Detection focuses on identifying samples that deviate from the norm.
When working with high-dimensional data such as images, a crucial requirement
for detecting anomalous patterns is learning lower-dimensional representations
that capture normal concepts seen during training. Recent advances in
self-supervised learning have shown great promise in this regard. However, many
of the most successful self-supervised anomaly detection methods assume prior
knowledge about the structure of anomalies and leverage synthetic anomalies
during training. Yet, in many real-world applications, we do not know what to
expect from unseen data, and we can solely leverage knowledge about normal
data. In this work, we propose Con2, which addresses this problem by setting
normal training data into distinct contexts while preserving its normal
properties, letting us observe the data from different perspectives. Unseen
normal data consequently adheres to learned context representations while
anomalies fail to do so, letting us detect them without any knowledge about
anomalies during training. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while exhibiting
superior performance in a more realistic healthcare setting, where knowledge
about potential anomalies is often scarce.

    <title>Achieving Fairness Across Local and Global Models in Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Achieving fairness across diverse clients in Federated Learning (FL) remains
a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity of the data and the
inaccessibility of sensitive attributes from clients' private datasets. This
study addresses this issue by introducing \texttt{EquiFL}, a novel approach
designed to enhance both local and global fairness in federated learning
environments. \texttt{EquiFL} incorporates a fairness term into the local
optimization objective, effectively balancing local performance and fairness.
The proposed coordination mechanism also prevents bias from propagating across
clients during the collaboration phase. Through extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that \texttt{EquiFL} not only strikes a
better balance between accuracy and fairness locally at each client but also
achieves global fairness. The results also indicate that \texttt{EquiFL}
ensures uniform performance distribution among clients, thus contributing to
performance fairness. Furthermore, we showcase the benefits of \texttt{EquiFL}
in a real-world distributed dataset from a healthcare application, specifically
in predicting the effects of treatments on patients across various hospital
locations.

    <title>Benchmarks for Reinforcement Learning with Biased Offline Data and
  Imperfect Simulators</title>
    <summary>  In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications one cannot easily let the
agent act in the world; this is true for autonomous vehicles, healthcare
applications, and even some recommender systems, to name a few examples.
Offline RL provides a way to train agents without real-world exploration, but
is often faced with biases due to data distribution shifts, limited coverage,
and incomplete representation of the environment. To address these issues,
practical applications have tried to combine simulators with grounded offline
data, using so-called hybrid methods. However, constructing a reliable
simulator is in itself often challenging due to intricate system complexities
as well as missing or incomplete information. In this work, we outline four
principal challenges for combining offline data with imperfect simulators in
RL: simulator modeling error, partial observability, state and action
discrepancies, and hidden confounding. To help drive the RL community to pursue
these problems, we construct ``Benchmarks for Mechanistic Offline Reinforcement
Learning'' (B4MRL), which provide dataset-simulator benchmarks for the
aforementioned challenges. Our results suggest the key necessity of such
benchmarks for future research.

    <title>Security and Privacy for Healthcare Blockchains</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare blockchains provide an innovative way to store healthcare
information, execute healthcare transactions, and build trust for healthcare
data sharing and data integration in a decentralized open healthcare network
environment. Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad
interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and
privacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for
information sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to
research collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and privacy
requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a
comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements,
accompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss
the security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic
medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we
categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for
electronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing
these security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage
scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures,
attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for
smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain
application scenarios in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will
help healthcare professionals, decision makers, and healthcare service
developers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security and
privacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements,
development and deployment technologies and systems.

    <title>DispaRisk: Assessing and Interpreting Disparity Risks in Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning algorithms (ML) impact virtually every aspect of human lives
and have found use across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and
education. Often, ML algorithms have been found to exacerbate societal biases
presented in datasets, leading to adversarial impacts on subsets/groups of
individuals, in many cases minority groups. To effectively mitigate these
untoward effects, it is crucial that disparities/biases are identified and
assessed early in a ML pipeline. This proactive approach facilitates timely
interventions to prevent bias amplification and reduce complexity at later
stages of model development. In this paper, we introduce DispaRisk, a novel
framework designed to proactively assess the potential risks of disparities in
datasets during the initial stages of the ML pipeline. We evaluate DispaRisk's
effectiveness by benchmarking it with commonly used datasets in fairness
research. Our findings demonstrate the capabilities of DispaRisk to identify
datasets with a high-risk of discrimination, model families prone to biases,
and characteristics that heighten discrimination susceptibility in a ML
pipeline. The code for our experiments is available in the following

    <summary>  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a popular way to organise information based on
ontologies or schemas and have been used across a variety of scenarios from
search to recommendation. Despite advances in KGs, representing knowledge
remains a non-trivial task across industries and it is especially challenging
in the biomedical and healthcare domains due to complex interdependent
relations between entities, heterogeneity, lack of standardization, and
sparseness of data. KGs are used to discover diagnoses or prioritize genes
relevant to disease, but they often rely on schemas that are not centred around
a node or entity of interest, such as a person. Entity-centric KGs are
relatively unexplored but hold promise in representing important facets
connected to a central node and unlocking downstream tasks beyond graph
traversal and reasoning, such as generating graph embeddings and training graph
neural networks for a wide range of predictive tasks. This paper presents an
end-to-end representation learning framework to extract entity-centric KGs from
structured and unstructured data. We introduce a star-shaped ontology to
represent the multiple facets of a person and use it to guide KG creation.
Compact representations of the graphs are created leveraging graph neural
networks and experiments are conducted using different levels of heterogeneity
or explicitness. A readmission prediction task is used to evaluate the results
of the proposed framework, showing a stable system, robust to missing data,
that outperforms a range of baseline machine learning classifiers. We highlight
that this approach has several potential applications across domains and is
open-sourced. Lastly, we discuss lessons learned, challenges, and next steps
for the adoption of the framework in practice.

    <title>A systematic literature review on machine learning applications for
  consumer sentiment analysis using online reviews</title>
    <summary>  Consumer sentiment analysis is a recent fad for social media related
applications such as healthcare, crime, finance, travel, and academics.
Disentangling consumer perception to gain insight into the desired objective
and reviews is significant. With the advancement of technology, a massive
amount of social web-data increasing in terms of volume, subjectivity, and
heterogeneity, becomes challenging to process it manually. Machine learning
techniques have been utilized to handle this difficulty in real-life
applications. This paper presents the study to find out the usefulness, scope,
and applicability of this alliance of Machine Learning techniques for consumer
sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism.
We have shown a systematic literature review to compare, analyze, explore, and
understand the attempts and direction in a proper way to find research gaps to
illustrating the future scope of this pairing. This work is contributing to the
extant literature in two ways; firstly, the primary objective is to read and
analyze the use of machine learning techniques for consumer sentiment analysis
on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. Secondly, in this
work, we presented a systematic approach to identify, collect observational
evidence, results from the analysis, and assimilate observations of all related
high-quality research to address particular research queries referring to the
described research area.

    <title>MOFit: A Framework to reduce Obesity using Machine learning and IoT</title>
    <summary>  From the past few years, due to advancements in technologies, the sedentary
living style in urban areas is at its peak. This results in individuals getting
a victim of obesity at an early age. There are various health impacts of
obesity like Diabetes, Heart disease, Blood pressure problems, and many more.
Machine learning from the past few years is showing its implications in all
expertise like forecasting, healthcare, medical imaging, sentiment analysis,
etc. In this work, we aim to provide a framework that uses machine learning
algorithms namely, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and KNN
to train models that would help predict obesity levels (Classification),
Bodyweight, and fat percentage levels (Regression) using various parameters. We
also applied and compared various hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms
such as Genetic algorithm, Random Search, Grid Search, Optuna to further
improve the accuracy of the models. The website framework contains various
other features like making customizable Diet plans, workout plans, and a
dashboard to track the progress. The framework is built using the Python Flask.
Furthermore, a weighing scale using the Internet of Things (IoT) is also
integrated into the framework to track calories and macronutrients from food
intake.

    <title>FairLens: Auditing Black-box Clinical Decision Support Systems</title>
    <summary>  The pervasive application of algorithmic decision-making is raising concerns
on the risk of unintended bias in AI systems deployed in critical settings such
as healthcare. The detection and mitigation of biased models is a very delicate
task which should be tackled with care and involving domain experts in the
loop. In this paper we introduce FairLens, a methodology for discovering and
explaining biases. We show how our tool can be used to audit a fictional
commercial black-box model acting as a clinical decision support system. In
this scenario, the healthcare facility experts can use FairLens on their own
historical data to discover the model's biases before incorporating it into the
clinical decision flow. FairLens first stratifies the available patient data
according to attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender and insurance; it then
assesses the model performance on such subgroups of patients identifying those
in need of expert evaluation. Finally, building on recent state-of-the-art XAI
(eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) techniques, FairLens explains which
elements in patients' clinical history drive the model error in the selected
subgroup. Therefore, FairLens allows experts to investigate whether to trust
the model and to spotlight group-specific biases that might constitute
potential fairness issues.

    <title>Towards the Use of Saliency Maps for Explaining Low-Quality
  Electrocardiograms to End Users</title>
    <summary>  When using medical images for diagnosis, either by clinicians or artificial
intelligence (AI) systems, it is important that the images are of high quality.
When an image is of low quality, the medical exam that produced the image often
needs to be redone. In telemedicine, a common problem is that the quality issue
is only flagged once the patient has left the clinic, meaning they must return
in order to have the exam redone. This can be especially difficult for people
living in remote regions, who make up a substantial portion of the patients at
Portal Telemedicina, a digital healthcare organization based in Brazil. In this
paper, we report on ongoing work regarding (i) the development of an AI system
for flagging and explaining low-quality medical images in real-time, (ii) an
interview study to understand the explanation needs of stakeholders using the
AI system at OurCompany, and, (iii) a longitudinal user study design to examine
the effect of including explanations on the workflow of the technicians in our
clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first longitudinal
study on evaluating the effects of XAI methods on end-users -- stakeholders
that use AI systems but do not have AI-specific expertise. We welcome feedback
and suggestions on our experimental setup.

    <title>Using Entropy Measures for Monitoring the Evolution of Activity Patterns</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we apply information theory inspired methods to quantify
changes in daily activity patterns. We use in-home movement monitoring data and
show how they can help indicate the occurrence of healthcare-related events.
Three different types of entropy measures namely Shannon's entropy, entropy
rates for Markov chains, and entropy production rate have been utilised. The
measures are evaluated on a large-scale in-home monitoring dataset that has
been collected within our dementia care clinical study. The study uses Internet
of Things (IoT) enabled solutions for continuous monitoring of in-home
activity, sleep, and physiology to develop care and early intervention
solutions to support people living with dementia (PLWD) in their own homes. Our
main goal is to show the applicability of the entropy measures to time-series
activity data analysis and to use the extracted measures as new engineered
features that can be fed into inference and analysis models. The results of our
experiments show that in most cases the combination of these measures can
indicate the occurrence of healthcare-related events. We also find that
different participants with the same events may have different measures based
on one entropy measure. So using a combination of these measures in an
inference model will be more effective than any of the single measures.

    <title>TRIALSCOPE: A Unifying Causal Framework for Scaling Real-World Evidence
  Generation with Biomedical Language Models</title>
    <summary>  The rapid digitization of real-world data offers an unprecedented opportunity
for optimizing healthcare delivery and accelerating biomedical discovery. In
practice, however, such data is most abundantly available in unstructured
forms, such as clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs), and it is
generally plagued by confounders. In this paper, we present TRIALSCOPE, a
unifying framework for distilling real-world evidence from population-level
observational data. TRIALSCOPE leverages biomedical language models to
structure clinical text at scale, employs advanced probabilistic modeling for
denoising and imputation, and incorporates state-of-the-art causal inference
techniques to combat common confounders. Using clinical trial specification as
generic representation, TRIALSCOPE provides a turn-key solution to generate and
reason with clinical hypotheses using observational data. In extensive
experiments and analyses on a large-scale real-world dataset with over one
million cancer patients from a large US healthcare network, we show that
TRIALSCOPE can produce high-quality structuring of real-world data and
generates comparable results to marquee cancer trials. In addition to
facilitating in-silicon clinical trial design and optimization, TRIALSCOPE may
be used to empower synthetic controls, pragmatic trials, post-market
surveillance, as well as support fine-grained patient-like-me reasoning in
precision diagnosis and treatment.

    <title>Why Is My Classifier Discriminatory?</title>
    <summary>  Recent attempts to achieve fairness in predictive models focus on the balance
between fairness and accuracy. In sensitive applications such as healthcare or
criminal justice, this trade-off is often undesirable as any increase in
prediction error could have devastating consequences. In this work, we argue
that the fairness of predictions should be evaluated in context of the data,
and that unfairness induced by inadequate samples sizes or unmeasured
predictive variables should be addressed through data collection, rather than
by constraining the model. We decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination
into bias, variance, and noise, and propose actions aimed at estimating and
reducing each term. Finally, we perform case-studies on prediction of income,
mortality, and review ratings, confirming the value of this analysis. We find
that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination without
sacrificing accuracy.

    <title>A Secure Authentication Technique in Internet of Medical Things through
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  The rapid growth of the Internet of Things technology in healthcare domain
led to the appearance of many security threats and risks. It became very
challenging to provide full protection with the expansion in using sensor
objects in medical field, this led to the Internet of Medical Things
definition, the security part in IoMT poses a perilous problem that keeps
growing, because of the data sensitivity and critical information. The lack of
providing a secure environment in IoMT may lead to patients privacy issues, not
only leaving the data privacy of the patients at risk but also their lives can
be in danger. In this paper, we provide a discussion on both definition and
architecture of the Internet of Medical Things and Propose a new authentication
approach through machine learning, to enhance the security level.

    <title>Discordance Minimization-based Imputation Algorithms for Missing Values
  in Rating Data</title>
    <summary>  Ratings are frequently used to evaluate and compare subjects in various
applications, from education to healthcare, because ratings provide succinct
yet credible measures for comparing subjects. However, when multiple rating
lists are combined or considered together, subjects often have missing ratings,
because most rating lists do not rate every subject in the combined list. In
this study, we propose analyses on missing value patterns using six real-world
data sets in various applications, as well as the conditions for applicability
of imputation algorithms. Based on the special structures and properties
derived from the analyses, we propose optimization models and algorithms that
minimize the total rating discordance across rating providers to impute missing
ratings in the combined rating lists, using only the known rating information.
The total rating discordance is defined as the sum of the pairwise discordance
metric, which can be written as a quadratic function. Computational experiments
based on real-world and synthetic rating data sets show that the proposed
methods outperform the state-of-the-art general imputation methods in the
literature in terms of imputation accuracy.

    <title>Trusted Multi-Party Computation and Verifiable Simulations: A Scalable
  Blockchain Approach</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale computational experiments, often running over weeks and over
large datasets, are used extensively in fields such as epidemiology,
meteorology, computational biology, and healthcare to understand phenomena, and
design high-stakes policies affecting everyday health and economy. For
instance, the OpenMalaria framework is a computationally-intensive simulation
used by various non-governmental and governmental agencies to understand
malarial disease spread and effectiveness of intervention strategies, and
subsequently design healthcare policies. Given that such shared results form
the basis of inferences drawn, technological solutions designed, and day-to-day
policies drafted, it is essential that the computations are validated and
trusted. In particular, in a multi-agent environment involving several
independent computing agents, a notion of trust in results generated by peers
is critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration.
Using a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computation
blocks and a blockchain-based immutable audits mechanism, this work proposes a
universal framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular we
address the scalaibility problem by reducing the storage and communication
costs using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not only
verifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations,
and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example of
training a neural network.

    <title>MAISON -- Multimodal AI-based Sensor platform for Older Individuals</title>
    <summary>  There is a global aging population requiring the need for the right tools
that can enable older adults' greater independence and the ability to age at
home, as well as assist healthcare workers. It is feasible to achieve this
objective by building predictive models that assist healthcare workers in
monitoring and analyzing older adults' behavioral, functional, and
psychological data. To develop such models, a large amount of multimodal sensor
data is typically required. In this paper, we propose MAISON, a scalable
cloud-based platform of commercially available smart devices capable of
collecting desired multimodal sensor data from older adults and patients living
in their own homes. The MAISON platform is novel due to its ability to collect
a greater variety of data modalities than the existing platforms, as well as
its new features that result in seamless data collection and ease of use for
older adults who may not be digitally literate. We demonstrated the feasibility
of the MAISON platform with two older adults discharged home from a large
rehabilitation center. The results indicate that the MAISON platform was able
to collect and store sensor data in a cloud without functional glitches or
performance degradation. This paper will also discuss the challenges faced
during the development of the platform and data collection in the homes of
older adults. MAISON is a novel platform designed to collect multimodal data
and facilitate the development of predictive models for detecting key health
indicators, including social isolation, depression, and functional decline, and
is feasible to use with older adults in the community.

    <title>Distillation to Enhance the Portability of Risk Models Across
  Institutions with Large Patient Claims Database</title>
    <summary>  Artificial intelligence, and particularly machine learning (ML), is
increasingly developed and deployed to support healthcare in a variety of
settings. However, clinical decision support (CDS) technologies based on ML
need to be portable if they are to be adopted on a broad scale. In this
respect, models developed at one institution should be reusable at another. Yet
there are numerous examples of portability failure, particularly due to naive
application of ML models. Portability failure can lead to suboptimal care and
medical errors, which ultimately could prevent the adoption of ML-based CDS in
practice. One specific healthcare challenge that could benefit from enhanced
portability is the prediction of 30-day readmission risk. Research to date has
shown that deep learning models can be effective at modeling such risk. In this
work, we investigate the practicality of model portability through a cross-site
evaluation of readmission prediction models. To do so, we apply a recurrent
neural network, augmented with self-attention and blended with expert features,
to build readmission prediction models for two independent large scale claims
datasets. We further present a novel transfer learning technique that adapts
the well-known method of born-again network (BAN) training. Our experiments
show that direct application of ML models trained at one institution and tested
at another institution perform worse than models trained and tested at the same
institution. We further show that the transfer learning approach based on the
BAN produces models that are better than those trained on just a single
institution's data. Notably, this improvement is consistent across both sites
and occurs after a single retraining, which illustrates the potential for a
cheap and general model transfer mechanism of readmission risk prediction.

    <title>Monitoring machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction algorithms in the
  presence of confounding medical interventions</title>
    <summary>  Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models
in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions
(CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse
event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and
alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is
to ignore CMI and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain
unaltered. In general, ignoring CMI may inflate Type I error because (i)
untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk
and (ii) evolution in both the model and clinician trust in the model can
induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we
show that valid inference is still possible if one monitors conditional
performance and if either conditional exchangeability or time-constant
selection bias hold. Specifically, we develop a new score-based cumulative sum
(CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits. Through simulations,
we demonstrate the benefits of combining model updating with monitoring and
investigate how over-trust in a prediction model may delay detection of
performance deterioration. Finally, we illustrate how these monitoring methods
can be used to detect calibration decay of an ML-based risk calculator for
postoperative nausea and vomiting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Sensitive Data Detection with High-Throughput Machine Learning Models in
  Electrical Health Records</title>
    <summary>  In the era of big data, there is an increasing need for healthcare providers,
communities, and researchers to share data and collaborate to improve health
outcomes, generate valuable insights, and advance research. The Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law
designed to protect sensitive health information by defining regulations for
protected health information (PHI). However, it does not provide efficient
tools for detecting or removing PHI before data sharing. One of the challenges
in this area of research is the heterogeneous nature of PHI fields in data
across different parties. This variability makes rule-based sensitive variable
identification systems that work on one database fail on another. To address
this issue, our paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to
identify sensitive variables in structured data, thus facilitating the
de-identification process. We made a key observation that the distributions of
metadata of PHI fields and non-PHI fields are very different. Based on this
novel finding, we engineered over 30 features from the metadata of the original
features and used machine learning to build classification models to
automatically identify PHI fields in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR)
data. We trained the model on a variety of large EHR databases from different
data sources and found that our algorithm achieves 99% accuracy when detecting
PHI-related fields for unseen datasets. The implications of our study are
significant and can benefit industries that handle sensitive data.

    <title>Data Quality in Edge Machine Learning: A State-of-the-Art Survey</title>
    <summary>  Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems trained using Machine
Learning (ML) are shaping an ever-increasing (in size and importance) portion
of our lives, including, but not limited to, recommendation systems, autonomous
driving technologies, healthcare diagnostics, financial services, and
personalized marketing. On the one hand, the outsized influence of these
systems imposes a high standard of quality, particularly in the data used to
train them. On the other hand, establishing and maintaining standards of Data
Quality (DQ) becomes more challenging due to the proliferation of Edge
Computing and Internet of Things devices, along with their increasing adoption
for training and deploying ML models. The nature of the edge environment --
characterized by limited resources, decentralized data storage, and processing
-- exacerbates data-related issues, making them more frequent, severe, and
difficult to detect and mitigate. From these observations, it follows that DQ
research for edge ML is a critical and urgent exploration track for the safety
and robust usefulness of present and future AI systems. Despite this fact, DQ
research for edge ML is still in its infancy. The literature on this subject
remains fragmented and scattered across different research communities, with no
comprehensive survey to date. Hence, this paper aims to fill this gap by
providing a global view of the existing literature from multiple disciplines
that can be grouped under the umbrella of DQ for edge ML. Specifically, we
present a tentative definition of data quality in Edge computing, which we use
to establish a set of DQ dimensions. We explore each dimension in detail,
including existing solutions for mitigation.

    <title>Interpretable Sequence Classification via Discrete Optimization</title>
    <summary>  Sequence classification is the task of predicting a class label given a
sequence of observations. In many applications such as healthcare monitoring or
intrusion detection, early classification is crucial to prompt intervention. In
this work, we learn sequence classifiers that favour early classification from
an evolving observation trace. While many state-of-the-art sequence classifiers
are neural networks, and in particular LSTMs, our classifiers take the form of
finite state automata and are learned via discrete optimization. Our
automata-based classifiers are interpretable---supporting explanation,
counterfactual reasoning, and human-in-the-loop modification---and have strong
empirical performance. Experiments over a suite of goal recognition and
behaviour classification datasets show our learned automata-based classifiers
to have comparable test performance to LSTM-based classifiers, with the added
advantage of being interpretable.

    <title>Deep Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Time series anomaly detection has applications in a wide range of research
fields and applications, including manufacturing and healthcare. The presence
of anomalies can indicate novel or unexpected events, such as production
faults, system defects, or heart fluttering, and is therefore of particular
interest. The large size and complex patterns of time series have led
researchers to develop specialised deep learning models for detecting anomalous
patterns. This survey focuses on providing structured and comprehensive
state-of-the-art time series anomaly detection models through the use of deep
learning. It providing a taxonomy based on the factors that divide anomaly
detection models into different categories. Aside from describing the basic
anomaly detection technique for each category, the advantages and limitations
are also discussed. Furthermore, this study includes examples of deep anomaly
detection in time series across various application domains in recent years. It
finally summarises open issues in research and challenges faced while adopting
deep anomaly detection models.

    <title>LANISTR: Multimodal Learning from Structured and Unstructured Data</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal large-scale pretraining has shown impressive performance for
unstructured data such as language and image. However, a prevalent real-world
scenario involves structured data types, tabular and time-series, along with
unstructured data. Such scenarios have been understudied. To bridge this gap,
we propose LANISTR, an attention-based framework to learn from LANguage, Image,
and STRuctured data. The core of LANISTR's methodology is rooted in
\textit{masking-based} training applied across both unimodal and multimodal
levels. In particular, we introduce a new similarity-based multimodal masking
loss that enables it to learn cross-modal relations from large-scale multimodal
data with missing modalities. On two real-world datasets, MIMIC-IV (from
healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (from retail), LANISTR demonstrates
remarkable improvements, 6.6\% (in AUROC) and 14\% (in accuracy) when
fine-tuned with 0.1\% and 0.01\% of labeled data, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, these improvements are observed even
with very high ratio of samples (35.7\% and 99.8\% respectively) not containing
all modalities, underlining the robustness of LANISTR to practical missing
modality challenge. Our code and models will be available at
https://github.com/google-research/lanistr

    <title>Rapid Image Labeling via Neuro-Symbolic Learning</title>
    <summary>  The success of Computer Vision (CV) relies heavily on manually annotated
data. However, it is prohibitively expensive to annotate images in key domains
such as healthcare, where data labeling requires significant domain expertise
and cannot be easily delegated to crowd workers. To address this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic approach called Rapid, which infers image labeling
rules from a small amount of labeled data provided by domain experts and
automatically labels unannotated data using the rules. Specifically, Rapid
combines pre-trained CV models and inductive logic learning to infer the
logic-based labeling rules. Rapid achieves a labeling accuracy of 83.33% to
88.33% on four image labeling tasks with only 12 to 39 labeled samples. In
particular, Rapid significantly outperforms finetuned CV models in two highly
specialized tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Rapid in
learning from small data and its capability to generalize among different
tasks. Code and our dataset are publicly available at

    <title>Data Augmentations for Improved (Large) Language Model Generalization</title>
    <summary>  The reliance of text classifiers on spurious correlations can lead to poor
generalization at deployment, raising concerns about their use in
safety-critical domains such as healthcare. In this work, we propose to use
counterfactual data augmentation, guided by knowledge of the causal structure
of the data, to simulate interventions on spurious features and to learn more
robust text classifiers. We show that this strategy is appropriate in
prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute.
Under the assumptions of such problems, we discuss the favorable sample
complexity of counterfactual data augmentation, compared to importance
re-weighting. Pragmatically, we match examples using auxiliary data, based on
diff-in-diff methodology, and use a large language model (LLM) to represent a
conditional probability of text. Through extensive experimentation on learning
caregiver-invariant predictors of clinical diagnoses from medical narratives
and on semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate that our method for simulating
interventions improves out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to baseline
invariant learning algorithms.

    <title>TrojFair: Trojan Fairness Attacks</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning models have been incorporated into high-stakes sectors,
including healthcare diagnosis, loan approvals, and candidate recruitment,
among others. Consequently, any bias or unfairness in these models can harm
those who depend on such models. In response, many algorithms have emerged to
ensure fairness in deep learning. However, while the potential for harm is
substantial, the resilience of these fair deep learning models against
malicious attacks has never been thoroughly explored, especially in the context
of emerging Trojan attacks. Moving beyond prior research, we aim to fill this
void by introducing \textit{TrojFair}, a Trojan fairness attack. Unlike
existing attacks, TrojFair is model-agnostic and crafts a Trojaned model that
functions accurately and equitably for clean inputs. However, it displays
discriminatory behaviors \text{-} producing both incorrect and unfair results
\text{-} for specific groups with tainted inputs containing a trigger. TrojFair
is a stealthy Fairness attack that is resilient to existing model fairness
audition detectors since the model for clean inputs is fair. TrojFair achieves
a target group attack success rate exceeding $88.77\%$, with an average
accuracy loss less than $0.44\%$. It also maintains a high discriminative score
between the target and non-target groups across various datasets and models.

    <title>MPCPA: Multi-Center Privacy Computing with Predictions Aggregation based
  on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
    <summary>  Privacy-preserving computing is crucial for multi-center machine learning in
many applications such as healthcare and finance. In this paper a Multi-center
Privacy Computing framework with Predictions Aggregation (MPCPA) based on
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is proposed, in which
conditional diffusion model training, DDPM data generation, a classifier, and
strategy of prediction aggregation are included. Compared to federated
learning, this framework necessitates fewer communications and leverages
high-quality generated data to support robust privacy computing. Experimental
validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework
outperforms classic federated learning and approaches the performance of
centralized learning with original data. Moreover, our approach demonstrates
robust security, effectively addressing challenges such as image memorization
and membership inference attacks. Our experiments underscore the efficacy of
the proposed framework in the realm of privacy computing, with the code set to
be released soon.

    <title>New Vietnamese Corpus for Machine Reading Comprehension of Health News
  Articles</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale and high-quality corpora are necessary for evaluating machine
reading comprehension models on a low-resource language like Vietnamese.
Besides, machine reading comprehension (MRC) for the health domain offers great
potential for practical applications; however, there is still very little MRC
research in this domain. This paper presents ViNewsQA as a new corpus for the
Vietnamese language to evaluate healthcare reading comprehension models. The
corpus comprises 22,057 human-generated question-answer pairs. Crowd-workers
create the questions and their answers based on a collection of over 4,416
online Vietnamese healthcare news articles, where the answers comprise spans
extracted from the corresponding articles. In particular, we develop a process
of creating a corpus for the Vietnamese machine reading comprehension.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our corpus requires abilities beyond
simple reasoning, such as word matching and demanding difficult reasoning based
on single-or-multiple-sentence information. We conduct experiments using
different types of machine reading comprehension methods to achieve the first
baseline performances, compared with further models' performances. We also
measure human performance on the corpus and compared it with several powerful
neural network-based and transfer learning-based models. Our experiments show
that the best machine model is ALBERT, which achieves an exact match score of
65.26% and an F1-score of 84.89% on our corpus. The significant differences
between humans and the best-performance model (14.53% of EM and 10.90% of
F1-score) on the test set of our corpus indicate that improvements in ViNewsQA
could be explored in the future study. Our corpus is publicly available on our
website for the research purpose to encourage the research community to make
these improvements.

    <title>Personal Mental Health Navigator: Harnessing the Power of Data, Personal
  Models, and Health Cybernetics to Promote Psychological Well-being</title>
    <summary>  Traditionally, the regime of mental healthcare has followed an episodic
psychotherapy model wherein patients seek care from a provider through a
prescribed treatment plan developed over multiple provider visits. Recent
advances in wearable and mobile technology have generated increased interest in
digital mental healthcare that enables individuals to address episodic mental
health symptoms. However, these efforts are typically reactive and
symptom-focused and do not provide comprehensive, wrap-around, customized
treatments that capture an individual's holistic mental health model as it
unfolds over time. Recognizing that each individual is unique, we present the
notion of Personalized Mental Health Navigation (MHN): a therapist-in-the-loop,
cybernetic goal-based system that deploys a continuous cyclic loop of
measurement, estimation, guidance, to steer the individual's mental health
state towards a healthy zone. We outline the major components of MHN that is
premised on the development of an individual's personal mental health state,
holistically represented by a high-dimensional cover of multiple knowledge
layers such as emotion, biological patterns, sociology, behavior, and
cognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the personalized MHN approach via
a 12-month pilot case study for holistic stress management in college students
and highlight an instance of a therapist-in-the-loop intervention using MHN for
monitoring, estimating, and proactively addressing moderately severe depression
over a sustained period of time. We believe MHN paves the way to transform
mental healthcare from the current passive, episodic, reactive process (where
individuals seek help to address symptoms that have already manifested) to a
continuous and navigational paradigm that leverages a personalized model of the
individual, promising to deliver timely interventions to individuals in a
holistic manner.

    <title>Developing patient-driven artificial intelligence based on personal
  rankings of care decision making steps</title>
    <summary>  We propose and experimentally motivate a new methodology to support
decision-making processes in healthcare with artificial intelligence based on
personal rankings of care decision making steps that can be identified with our
methodology, questionnaire data and its statistical patterns. Our longitudinal
quantitative cross-sectional three-stage study gathered self-ratings for 437
expression statements concerning healthcare situations on Likert scales in
respect to "the need for help", "the advancement of health", "the hopefulness",
"the indication of compassion" and "the health condition", and 45 answers about
the person's demographics, health and wellbeing, also the duration of giving
answers. Online respondents between 1 June 2020 and 29 June 2021 were recruited
from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other health-related
organizations and professionals, and educational institutions (n=1075). With
Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test (i.e., Mann-Whitney U test),
Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise test, Welch's t test and one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) between groups test we identified statistically significant
differences of ratings and their durations for each expression statement in
respect to respondent groupings based on the answer values of each background
question. Frequencies of the later reordering of rating rankings showed
dependencies with ratings given earlier in respect to various interpretation
task entities, interpretation dimensions and respondent groupings. Our
methodology, questionnaire data and its statistical patterns enable analyzing
with self-rated expression statements the representations of decision making
steps in healthcare situations and their chaining, agglomeration and branching
in knowledge entities of personalized care paths. Our results support building
artificial intelligence solutions to address the patient's needs concerning
care.

    <title>Assistive Chatbots for healthcare: a succinct review</title>
    <summary>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting healthcare services has never
been more necessitated than by the recent global pandemic. Here, we review the
state-of-the-art in AI-enabled Chatbots in healthcare proposed during the last
10 years (2013-2023). The focus on AI-enabled technology is because of its
potential for enhancing the quality of human-machine interaction via Chatbots,
reducing dependence on human-human interaction and saving man-hours. Our review
indicates that there are a handful of (commercial) Chatbots that are being used
for patient support, while there are others (non-commercial) that are in the
clinical trial phases. However, there is a lack of trust on this technology
regarding patient safety and data protection, as well as a lack of wider
awareness on its benefits among the healthcare workers and professionals. Also,
patients have expressed dissatisfaction with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
skills of the Chatbots in comparison to humans. Notwithstanding the recent
introduction of ChatGPT that has raised the bar for the NLP technology, this
Chatbot cannot be trusted with patient safety and medical ethics without
thorough and rigorous checks to serve in the `narrow' domain of assistive
healthcare. Our review suggests that to enable deployment and integration of
AI-enabled Chatbots in public health services, the need of the hour is: to
build technology that is simple and safe to use; to build confidence on the
technology among: (a) the medical community by focussed training and
development; (b) the patients and wider community through outreach.

    <title>Revolutionizing Future Healthcare using Wireless on the Walls (WoW)</title>
    <summary>  Following the standardization and deployment of fifth generation (5G)
network, researchers have shifted their focus to beyond 5G communication.
Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could
not have been imagined in the past years. Beyond 5G will enable us to rethink
the capability, it will offer in various sectors including agriculture, search
and rescue and more specifically in the delivery of health care services.
Unobtrusive and non-invasive measurements using radio frequency (RF) sensing,
monitoring and control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would
potentially benefit from beyond 5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device
charging and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge using millimetre
(mmWave) communication. The mmWaves experience multi-path induced fading, where
the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to the microwaves. Eventually,
mmWave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces.
A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will
have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent
surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls aka - Intelligent Walls are planar and
active surfaces, which will be a key element in beyond 5G and 6G communication.
These intelligent walls equipped with machine learning algorithm and
computation power would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as
gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the
application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation healthcare in
the era of beyond 5G.

    <title>Explanation Ontology: A Model of Explanations for User-Centered AI</title>
    <summary>  Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems since
their conception, with the need for explainability growing as more complex AI
models are increasingly used in critical, high-stakes settings such as
healthcare. Explanations have often added to an AI system in a non-principled,
post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on
user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation
that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs
to specific explanation types and the system's AI capabilities. We design an
explanation ontology to model both the role of explanations, accounting for the
system and user attributes in the process, and the range of different
literature-derived explanation types. We indicate how the ontology can support
user requirements for explanations in the domain of healthcare. We evaluate our
ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards a system designer
who might use our ontology to decide which explanation types to include, given
a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in system
design settings and in real-time operations. Through the use of this ontology,
system designers will be able to make informed choices on which explanations AI
systems can and should provide.

    <summary>  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are making significant progress in many
research areas where decision-making needs to be accompanied by uncertainty
estimation. Being able to quantify uncertainty while making decisions is
essential for understanding when the model is over-/under-confident, and hence
BNNs are attracting interest in safety-critical applications, such as
autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics. Nevertheless, BNNs have not been
as widely used in industrial practice, mainly because of their increased memory
and compute costs. In this work, we investigate quantisation of BNNs by
compressing 32-bit floating-point weights and activations to their integer
counterparts, that has already been successful in reducing the compute demand
in standard pointwise neural networks. We study three types of quantised BNNs,
we evaluate them under a wide range of different settings, and we empirically
demonstrate that a uniform quantisation scheme applied to BNNs does not
substantially decrease their quality of uncertainty estimation.

    <title>Generic Outlier Detection in Multi-Armed Bandit</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we study the problem of outlier arm detection in multi-armed
bandit settings, which finds plenty of applications in many high-impact domains
such as finance, healthcare, and online advertising. For this problem, a
learner aims to identify the arms whose expected rewards deviate significantly
from most of the other arms. Different from existing work, we target the
generic outlier arms or outlier arm groups whose expected rewards can be
larger, smaller, or even in between those of normal arms. To this end, we start
by providing a comprehensive definition of such generic outlier arms and
outlier arm groups. Then we propose a novel pulling algorithm named GOLD to
identify such generic outlier arms. It builds a real-time neighborhood graph
based on upper confidence bounds and catches the behavior pattern of outliers
from normal arms. We also analyze its performance from various aspects. In the
experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets, the proposed
algorithm achieves 98 % accuracy while saving 83 % exploration cost on average
compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

    <title>Robust Tensor Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery via
  Deterministic Model</title>
    <summary>  Tensor, also known as multi-dimensional array, arises from many applications
in signal processing, manufacturing processes, healthcare, among others. As one
of the most popular methods in tensor literature, Robust tensor principal
component analysis (RTPCA) is a very effective tool to extract the low rank and
sparse components in tensors. In this paper, a new method to analyze RTPCA is
proposed based on the recently developed tensor-tensor product and tensor
singular value decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, it aims to solve a convex
optimization problem whose objective function is a weighted combination of the
tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm. In most of literature of RTPCA, the exact
recovery is built on the tensor incoherence conditions and the assumption of a
uniform model on the sparse support. Unlike this conventional way, in this
paper, without any assumption of randomness, the exact recovery can be achieved
in a completely deterministic fashion by characterizing the tensor
rank-sparsity incoherence, which is an uncertainty principle between the
low-rank tensor spaces and the pattern of sparse tensor.

    <title>Rational Shapley Values</title>
    <summary>  Explaining the predictions of opaque machine learning algorithms is an
important and challenging task, especially as complex models are increasingly
used to assist in high-stakes decisions such as those arising in healthcare and
finance. Most popular tools for post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) are either insensitive to context (e.g., feature attributions) or
difficult to summarize (e.g., counterfactuals). In this paper, I introduce
$\textit{rational Shapley values}$, a novel XAI method that synthesizes and
extends these seemingly incompatible approaches in a rigorous, flexible manner.
I leverage tools from decision theory and causal modeling to formalize and
implement a pragmatic approach that resolves a number of known challenges in
XAI. By pairing the distribution of random variables with the appropriate
reference class for a given explanation task, I illustrate through theory and
experiments how user goals and knowledge can inform and constrain the solution
set in an iterative fashion. The method compares favorably to state of the art
XAI tools in a range of quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

    <title>Atrial Fibrillation: A Medical and Technological Review</title>
    <summary>  Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia (Greek a-,
loss + rhythmos, rhythm = loss of rhythm) leading to hospitalization in the
United States. Though sometimes AF is asymptomatic, it increases the risk of
stroke and heart failure in patients, in addition to lowering the
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). AF-related care costs the healthcare
system between $6.0 to $26 billion each year. Early detection of AF and
clinical attention can help improve symptoms and HRQOL of the patient, as well
as bring down the cost of care. However, the prevalent paradigm of AF detection
depends on electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded at a single point in time and does
not shed light on the relation of the symptoms with heart rhythm or AF. In the
recent decade, due to the democratization of health monitors and the advent of
high-performing computers, Machine Learning algorithms have been proven
effective in identifying AF, from the ECG of patients. This paper provides an
overview of the symptoms of AF, its diagnosis, and future prospects for
research in the field.

    <title>Performance of different machine learning methods on activity
  recognition and pose estimation datasets</title>
    <summary>  With advancements in computer vision taking place day by day, recently a lot
of light is being shed on activity recognition. With the range for real-world
applications utilizing this field of study increasing across a multitude of
industries such as security and healthcare, it becomes crucial for businesses
to distinguish which machine learning methods perform better than others in the
area. This paper strives to aid in this predicament i.e. building upon previous
related work, it employs both classical and ensemble approaches on rich pose
estimation (OpenPose) and HAR datasets. Making use of appropriate metrics to
evaluate the performance for each model, the results show that overall, random
forest yields the highest accuracy in classifying ADLs. Relatively all the
models have excellent performance across both datasets, except for logistic
regression and AdaBoost perform poorly in the HAR one. With the limitations of
this paper also discussed in the end, the scope for further research is vast,
which can use this paper as a base in aims of producing better results.

    <title>Self-Supervised Predictive Coding with Multimodal Fusion for Patient
  Deterioration Prediction in Fine-grained Time Resolution</title>
    <summary>  Accurate time prediction of patients' critical events is crucial in urgent
scenarios where timely decision-making is important. Though many studies have
proposed automatic prediction methods using Electronic Health Records (EHR),
their coarse-grained time resolutions limit their practical usage in urgent
environments such as the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit
(ICU). Therefore, in this study, we propose an hourly prediction method based
on self-supervised predictive coding and multi-modal fusion for two critical
tasks: mortality and vasopressor need prediction. Through extensive
experiments, we prove significant performance gains from both multi-modal
fusion and self-supervised predictive regularization, most notably in
far-future prediction, which becomes especially important in practice. Our
uni-modal/bi-modal/bi-modal self-supervision scored 0.846/0.877/0.897
(0.824/0.855/0.886) and 0.817/0.820/0.858 (0.807/0.81/0.855) with mortality
(far-future mortality) and with vasopressor need (far-future vasopressor need)
prediction data in AUROC, respectively.

    <title>Assessing Upper Limb Motor Function in the Immediate Post-Stroke Perioud
  Using Accelerometry</title>
    <summary>  Accelerometry has been extensively studied as an objective means of measuring
upper limb function in patients post-stroke. The objective of this paper is to
determine whether the accelerometry-derived measurements frequently used in
more long-term rehabilitation studies can also be used to monitor and rapidly
detect sudden changes in upper limb motor function in more recently
hospitalized stroke patients. Six binary classification models were created by
training on variable data window times of paretic upper limb accelerometer
feature data. The models were assessed on their effectiveness for
differentiating new input data into two classes: severe or moderately severe
motor function. The classification models yielded Area Under the Curve (AUC)
scores that ranged from 0.72 to 0.82 for 15-minute data windows to 0.77 to 0.94
for 120-minute data windows. These results served as a preliminary assessment
and a basis on which to further investigate the efficacy of using accelerometry
and machine learning to alert healthcare professionals to rapid changes in
motor function in the days immediately following a stroke.

    <title>Latent Time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
    <summary>  Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) have been proposed as a
continuous depth generalization to popular deep learning models such as
Residual networks (ResNets). They provide parameter efficiency and automate the
model selection process in deep learning models to some extent. However, they
lack the much-required uncertainty modelling and robustness capabilities which
are crucial for their use in several real-world applications such as autonomous
driving and healthcare. We propose a novel and unique approach to model
uncertainty in NODE by considering a distribution over the end-time $T$ of the
ODE solver. The proposed approach, latent time NODE (LT-NODE), treats $T$ as a
latent variable and apply Bayesian learning to obtain a posterior distribution
over $T$ from the data. In particular, we use variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior and the model parameters. Prediction is done by
considering the NODE representations from different samples of the posterior
and can be done efficiently using a single forward pass. As $T$ implicitly
defines the depth of a NODE, posterior distribution over $T$ would also help in
model selection in NODE. We also propose, adaptive latent time NODE (ALT-NODE),
which allow each data point to have a distinct posterior distribution over
end-times. ALT-NODE uses amortized variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior using inference networks. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches in modelling uncertainty and
robustness through experiments on synthetic and several real-world image
classification data.

    <title>Data-Efficient Pipeline for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Limited
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to improve future performance
by leveraging historical data. There exist many different algorithms for
offline RL, and it is well recognized that these algorithms, and their
hyperparameter settings, can lead to decision policies with substantially
differing performance. This prompts the need for pipelines that allow
practitioners to systematically perform algorithm-hyperparameter selection for
their setting. Critically, in most real-world settings, this pipeline must only
involve the use of historical data. Inspired by statistical model selection
methods for supervised learning, we introduce a task- and method-agnostic
pipeline for automatically training, comparing, selecting, and deploying the
best policy when the provided dataset is limited in size. In particular, our
work highlights the importance of performing multiple data splits to produce
more reliable algorithm-hyperparameter selection. While this is a common
approach in supervised learning, to our knowledge, this has not been discussed
in detail in the offline RL setting. We show it can have substantial impacts
when the dataset is small. Compared to alternate approaches, our proposed
pipeline outputs higher-performing deployed policies from a broad range of
offline policy learning algorithms and across various simulation domains in
healthcare, education, and robotics. This work contributes toward the
development of a general-purpose meta-algorithm for automatic
algorithm-hyperparameter selection for offline RL.

    <title>Reproducibility in Multiple Instance Learning: A Case For Algorithmic
  Unit Tests</title>
    <summary>  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a sub-domain of classification problems
with positive and negative labels and a "bag" of inputs, where the label is
positive if and only if a positive element is contained within the bag, and
otherwise is negative. Training in this context requires associating the
bag-wide label to instance-level information, and implicitly contains a causal
assumption and asymmetry to the task (i.e., you can't swap the labels without
changing the semantics). MIL problems occur in healthcare (one malignant cell
indicates cancer), cyber security (one malicious executable makes an infected
computer), and many other tasks. In this work, we examine five of the most
prominent deep-MIL models and find that none of them respects the standard MIL
assumption. They are able to learn anti-correlated instances, i.e., defaulting
to "positive" labels until seeing a negative counter-example, which should not
be possible for a correct MIL model. We suspect that enhancements and other
works derived from these models will share the same issue. In any context in
which these models are being used, this creates the potential for learning
incorrect models, which creates risk of operational failure. We identify and
demonstrate this problem via a proposed "algorithmic unit test", where we
create synthetic datasets that can be solved by a MIL respecting model, and
which clearly reveal learning that violates MIL assumptions. The five evaluated
methods each fail one or more of these tests. This provides a model-agnostic
way to identify violations of modeling assumptions, which we hope will be
useful for future development and evaluation of MIL models.

    <title>Federated Survival Forests</title>
    <summary>  Survival analysis is a subfield of statistics concerned with modeling the
occurrence time of a particular event of interest for a population. Survival
analysis found widespread applications in healthcare, engineering, and social
sciences. However, real-world applications involve survival datasets that are
distributed, incomplete, censored, and confidential. In this context, federated
learning can tremendously improve the performance of survival analysis
applications. Federated learning provides a set of privacy-preserving
techniques to jointly train machine learning models on multiple datasets
without compromising user privacy, leading to a better generalization
performance. However, despite the widespread development of federated learning
in recent AI research, few studies focus on federated survival analysis. In
this work, we present a novel federated algorithm for survival analysis based
on one of the most successful survival models, the random survival forest. We
call the proposed method Federated Survival Forest (FedSurF). With a single
communication round, FedSurF obtains a discriminative power comparable to
deep-learning-based federated models trained over hundreds of federated
iterations. Moreover, FedSurF retains all the advantages of random forests,
namely low computational cost and natural handling of missing values and
incomplete datasets. These advantages are especially desirable in real-world
federated environments with multiple small datasets stored on devices with low
computational capabilities. Numerical experiments compare FedSurF with
state-of-the-art survival models in federated networks, showing how FedSurF
outperforms deep-learning-based federated algorithms in realistic environments
with non-identically distributed data.

    <title>A Modulation Layer to Increase Neural Network Robustness Against Data
  Quality Issues</title>
    <summary>  Data missingness and quality are common problems in machine learning,
especially for high-stakes applications such as healthcare. Developers often
train machine learning models on carefully curated datasets using only high
quality data; however, this reduces the utility of such models in production
environments. We propose a novel neural network modification to mitigate the
impacts of low quality and missing data which involves replacing the fixed
weights of a fully-connected layer with a function of an additional input. This
is inspired from neuromodulation in biological neural networks where the cortex
can up- and down-regulate inputs based on their reliability and the presence of
other data. In testing, with reliability scores as a modulating signal, models
with modulating layers were found to be more robust against degradation of data
quality, including additional missingness. These models are superior to
imputation as they save on training time by completely skipping the imputation
process and further allow the introduction of other data quality measures that
imputation cannot handle. Our results suggest that explicitly accounting for
reduced information quality with a modulating fully connected layer can enable
the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in real-time applications.

    <title>L1-regularized neural ranking for risk stratification and its
  application to prediction of time to distant metastasis in luminal node
  negative chemotherapy naïve breast cancer patients</title>
    <summary>  Can we predict if an early stage cancer patient is at high risk of developing
distant metastasis and what clinicopathological factors are associated with
such a risk? In this paper, we propose a ranking based censoring-aware machine
learning model for answering such questions. The proposed model is able to
generate an interpretable formula for risk stratifi-cation using a minimal
number of clinicopathological covariates through L1-regulrization. Using this
approach, we analyze the association of time to distant metastasis (TTDM) with
various clinical parameters for early stage, luminal (ER+ or HER2-) breast
cancer patients who received endocrine therapy but no chemotherapy (n = 728).
The TTDM risk stratification formula obtained using the proposed approach is
primarily based on mitotic score, histolog-ical tumor type and lymphovascular
invasion. These findings corroborate with the known role of these covariates in
increased risk for distant metastasis. Our analysis shows that the proposed
risk stratification formula can discriminate between cases with high and low
risk of distant metastasis (p-value &lt; 0.005) and can also rank cases based on
their time to distant metastasis with a concordance-index of 0.73.

    <title>Rethinking Explainability as a Dialogue: A Practitioner's Perspective</title>
    <summary>  As practitioners increasingly deploy machine learning models in critical
domains such as health care, finance, and policy, it becomes vital to ensure
that domain experts function effectively alongside these models. Explainability
is one way to bridge the gap between human decision-makers and machine learning
models. However, most of the existing work on explainability focuses on
one-off, static explanations like feature importances or rule lists. These
sorts of explanations may not be sufficient for many use cases that require
dynamic, continuous discovery from stakeholders. In the literature, few works
ask decision-makers about the utility of existing explanations and other
desiderata they would like to see in an explanation going forward. In this
work, we address this gap and carry out a study where we interview doctors,
healthcare professionals, and policymakers about their needs and desires for
explanations. Our study indicates that decision-makers would strongly prefer
interactive explanations in the form of natural language dialogues. Domain
experts wish to treat machine learning models as "another colleague", i.e., one
who can be held accountable by asking why they made a particular decision
through expressive and accessible natural language interactions. Considering
these needs, we outline a set of five principles researchers should follow when
designing interactive explanations as a starting place for future work.
Further, we show why natural language dialogues satisfy these principles and
are a desirable way to build interactive explanations. Next, we provide a
design of a dialogue system for explainability and discuss the risks,
trade-offs, and research opportunities of building these systems. Overall, we
hope our work serves as a starting place for researchers and engineers to
design interactive explainability systems.

    <title>Interpretable by Design: Learning Predictors by Composing Interpretable
  Queries</title>
    <summary>  There is a growing concern about typically opaque decision-making with
high-performance machine learning algorithms. Providing an explanation of the
reasoning process in domain-specific terms can be crucial for adoption in
risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare. We argue that machine learning
algorithms should be interpretable by design and that the language in which
these interpretations are expressed should be domain- and task-dependent.
Consequently, we base our model's prediction on a family of user-defined and
task-specific binary functions of the data, each having a clear interpretation
to the end-user. We then minimize the expected number of queries needed for
accurate prediction on any given input. As the solution is generally
intractable, following prior work, we choose the queries sequentially based on
information gain. However, in contrast to previous work, we need not assume the
queries are conditionally independent. Instead, we leverage a stochastic
generative model (VAE) and an MCMC algorithm (Unadjusted Langevin) to select
the most informative query about the input based on previous query-answers.
This enables the online determination of a query chain of whatever depth is
required to resolve prediction ambiguities. Finally, experiments on vision and
NLP tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and its superiority over
post-hoc explanations.

    <title>Unveiling the Unborn: Advancing Fetal Health Classification through
  Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Fetal health classification is a critical task in obstetrics, enabling early
identification and management of potential health problems. However, it remains
challenging due to data complexity and limited labeled samples. This research
paper presents a novel machine-learning approach for fetal health
classification, leveraging a LightGBM classifier trained on a comprehensive
dataset. The proposed model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.31% on a test
set. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in enhancing
fetal health classification, offering a more objective and accurate assessment.
Notably, our approach combines various features, such as fetal heart rate,
uterine contractions, and maternal blood pressure, to provide a comprehensive
evaluation. This methodology holds promise for improving early detection and
treatment of fetal health issues, ensuring better outcomes for both mothers and
babies. Beyond the high accuracy achieved, the novelty of our approach lies in
its comprehensive feature selection and assessment methodology. By
incorporating multiple data points, our model offers a more holistic and
reliable evaluation compared to traditional methods. This research has
significant implications in the field of obstetrics, paving the way for
advancements in early detection and intervention of fetal health concerns.
Future work involves validating the model on a larger dataset and developing a
clinical application. Ultimately, we anticipate that our research will
revolutionize the assessment and management of fetal health, contributing to
improved healthcare outcomes for expectant mothers and their babies.

    <title>Enhancing Clinical Efficiency through LLM: Discharge Note Generation for
  Cardiac Patients</title>
    <summary>  Medical documentation, including discharge notes, is crucial for ensuring
patient care quality, continuity, and effective medical communication. However,
the manual creation of these documents is not only time-consuming but also
prone to inconsistencies and potential errors. The automation of this
documentation process using artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising
area of innovation in healthcare. This study directly addresses the
inefficiencies and inaccuracies in creating discharge notes manually,
particularly for cardiac patients, by employing AI techniques, specifically
large language model (LLM). Utilizing a substantial dataset from a cardiology
center, encompassing wide-ranging medical records and physician assessments,
our research evaluates the capability of LLM to enhance the documentation
process. Among the various models assessed, Mistral-7B distinguished itself by
accurately generating discharge notes that significantly improve both
documentation efficiency and the continuity of care for patients. These notes
underwent rigorous qualitative evaluation by medical expert, receiving high
marks for their clinical relevance, completeness, readability, and contribution
to informed decision-making and care planning. Coupled with quantitative
analyses, these results confirm Mistral-7B's efficacy in distilling complex
medical information into concise, coherent summaries. Overall, our findings
illuminate the considerable promise of specialized LLM, such as Mistral-7B, in
refining healthcare documentation workflows and advancing patient care. This
study lays the groundwork for further integrating advanced AI technologies in
healthcare, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize patient
documentation and support better care outcomes.

    <title>Transformer-based unsupervised patient representation learning based on
  medical claims for risk stratification and analysis</title>
    <summary>  The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred
expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual's health
condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based
Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can
learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from
the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to
stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and
management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model
inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular
time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the
rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We
trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than
600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two
clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior
performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are
also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising
results confirm that the TMAE framework is scalable to large claims data and is
able to generate efficient patient embeddings for risk stratification and
analysis.

    <title>Process Knowledge-infused Learning for Suicidality Assessment on Social
  Media</title>
    <summary>  Improving the performance and natural language explanations of deep learning
algorithms is a priority for adoption by humans in the real world. In several
domains, such as healthcare, such technology has significant potential to
reduce the burden on humans by providing quality assistance at scale. However,
current methods rely on the traditional pipeline of predicting labels from
data, thus completely ignoring the process and guidelines used to obtain the
labels. Furthermore, post hoc explanations on the data to label prediction
using explainable AI (XAI) models, while satisfactory to computer scientists,
leave much to be desired to the end-users due to lacking explanations of the
process in terms of human-understandable concepts. We \textit{introduce},
\textit{formalize}, and \textit{develop} a novel Artificial Intelligence (A)
paradigm -- Process Knowledge-infused Learning (PK-iL). PK-iL utilizes a
structured process knowledge that explicitly explains the underlying prediction
process that makes sense to end-users. The qualitative human evaluation
confirms through a annotator agreement of 0.72, that humans are understand
explanations for the predictions. PK-iL also performs competitively with the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

    <title>Personalized Dose Guidance using Safe Bayesian Optimization</title>
    <summary>  This work considers the problem of personalized dose guidance using Bayesian
optimization that learns the optimum drug dose tailored to each individual,
thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Safe learning using interior point method
ensures patient safety with high probability. This is demonstrated using the
problem of learning the optimum bolus insulin dose in patients with type 1
diabetes to counteract the effect of meal consumption. Starting from no a
priori information about the patients, our dose guidance algorithm is able to
improve the therapeutic outcome (measured in terms of % time-in-range) without
jeopardizing patient safety. Other potential healthcare applications are also
discussed.

    <title>Deep Attention Q-Network for Personalized Treatment Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  Tailoring treatment for individual patients is crucial yet challenging in
order to achieve optimal healthcare outcomes. Recent advances in reinforcement
learning offer promising personalized treatment recommendations; however, they
rely solely on current patient observations (vital signs, demographics) as the
patient's state, which may not accurately represent the true health status of
the patient. This limitation hampers policy learning and evaluation, ultimately
limiting treatment effectiveness. In this study, we propose the Deep Attention
Q-Network for personalized treatment recommendations, utilizing the Transformer
architecture within a deep reinforcement learning framework to efficiently
incorporate all past patient observations. We evaluated the model on real-world
sepsis and acute hypotension cohorts, demonstrating its superiority to
state-of-the-art models. The source code for our model is available at
https://github.com/stevenmsm/RL-ICU-DAQN.

    <title>FocusLearn: Fully-Interpretable, High-Performance Modular Neural
  Networks for Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time series have many applications, from healthcare and
meteorology to life science. Although deep learning models have shown excellent
predictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being
"black-boxes" or non-interpretable. This paper proposes a novel modular neural
network model for multivariate time series prediction that is interpretable by
construction. A recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in
the data while an attention-based feature selection component selects the most
relevant features and suppresses redundant features used in the learning of the
temporal dependencies. A modular deep network is trained from the selected
features independently to show the users how features influence outcomes,
making the model interpretable. Experimental results show that this approach
can outperform state-of-the-art interpretable Neural Additive Models (NAM) and
variations thereof in both regression and classification of time series tasks,
achieving a predictive performance that is comparable to the top
non-interpretable methods for time series, LSTM and XGBoost.

    <title>Freeze the backbones: A Parameter-Efficient Contrastive Approach to
  Robust Medical Vision-Language Pre-training</title>
    <summary>  Modern healthcare often utilises radiographic images alongside textual
reports for diagnostics, encouraging the use of Vision-Language Self-Supervised
Learning (VL-SSL) with large pre-trained models to learn versatile medical
vision representations. However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained
end-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information
embedded in pre-trained encoders. To address both issues, we introduce the
backbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in
pre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a
lightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning. Experiments on medical
image classification and segmentation tasks across three datasets reveal that
our framework delivers competitive performance while cutting trainable
parameters by over 90% compared to current pre-training approaches. Notably,
when fine-tuned with just 1% of data, Adaptor outperforms several
Transformer-based methods trained on full datasets in medical image
segmentation.

    <title>Sequential Decision Making with Expert Demonstrations under Unobserved
  Heterogeneity</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary
demonstrations from experts who made their decisions based on unobserved
contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related
but slightly different tasks than what the learner faces. This setting arises
in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and
finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information,
which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the
problem as a zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning setting with an unknown task
distribution and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved
tasks are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the
Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), a non-parametric empirical Bayes
approach that utilizes the principle of maximum entropy to establish an
informative prior over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior
enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making,
such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing
behaviour cloning and online algorithms for multi-armed bandits and
reinforcement learning, showcasing the utility of our approach in leveraging
expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups.

    <title>MediFact at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Medical Question Answering in Dermatology
  with Multimodal Learning</title>
    <summary>  The MEDIQA-M3G 2024 challenge necessitates novel solutions for Multilingual &amp;
Multimodal Medical Answer Generation in dermatology (wai Yim et al., 2024a).
This paper addresses the limitations of traditional methods by proposing a
weakly supervised learning approach for open-ended medical question-answering
(QA). Our system leverages readily available MEDIQA-M3G images via a
VGG16-CNN-SVM model, enabling multilingual (English, Chinese, Spanish) learning
of informative skin condition representations. Using pre-trained QA models, we
further bridge the gap between visual and textual information through
multimodal fusion. This approach tackles complex, open-ended questions even
without predefined answer choices. We empower the generation of comprehensive
answers by feeding the ViT-CLIP model with multiple responses alongside images.
This work advances medical QA research, paving the way for clinical decision
support systems and ultimately improving healthcare delivery.

    <title>Securing Health Data on the Blockchain: A Differential Privacy and
  Federated Learning Framework</title>
    <summary>  This study proposes a framework to enhance privacy in Blockchain-based
Internet of Things (BIoT) systems used in the healthcare sector. The framework
addresses the challenge of leveraging health data for analytics while
protecting patient privacy. To achieve this, the study integrates Differential
Privacy (DP) with Federated Learning (FL) to protect sensitive health data
collected by IoT nodes. The proposed framework utilizes dynamic personalization
and adaptive noise distribution strategies to balance privacy and data utility.
Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent aggregation
and storage of model updates. Experimental results on the SVHN dataset
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves strong privacy guarantees
against various attack scenarios while maintaining high accuracy in health
analytics tasks. For 15 rounds of federated learning with an epsilon value of
8.0, the model obtains an accuracy of 64.50%. The blockchain integration,
utilizing Ethereum, Ganache, Web3.py, and IPFS, exhibits an average transaction
latency of around 6 seconds and consistent gas consumption across rounds,
validating the practicality and feasibility of the proposed approach.

    <title>Medical Knowledge Integration into Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for
  Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
    <summary>  The goal of precision medicine is to provide individualized treatment at each
stage of chronic diseases, a concept formalized by Dynamic Treatment Regimes
(DTR). These regimes adapt treatment strategies based on decision rules learned
from clinical data to enhance therapeutic effectiveness. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) algorithms allow to determine these decision rules conditioned by
individual patient data and their medical history. The integration of medical
expertise into these models makes possible to increase confidence in treatment
recommendations and facilitate the adoption of this approach by healthcare
professionals and patients. In this work, we examine the mathematical
foundations of RL, contextualize its application in the field of DTR, and
present an overview of methods to improve its effectiveness by integrating
medical expertise.

    <title>Towards Safe Mechanical Ventilation Treatment Using Deep Offline
  Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Mechanical ventilation is a key form of life support for patients with
pulmonary impairment. Healthcare workers are required to continuously adjust
ventilator settings for each patient, a challenging and time consuming task.
Hence, it would be beneficial to develop an automated decision support tool to
optimize ventilation treatment. We present DeepVent, a Conservative Q-Learning
(CQL) based offline Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that learns to
predict the optimal ventilator parameters for a patient to promote 90 day
survival. We design a clinically relevant intermediate reward that encourages
continuous improvement of the patient vitals as well as addresses the challenge
of sparse reward in RL. We find that DeepVent recommends ventilation parameters
within safe ranges, as outlined in recent clinical trials. The CQL algorithm
offers additional safety by mitigating the overestimation of the value
estimates of out-of-distribution states/actions. We evaluate our agent using
Fitted Q Evaluation (FQE) and demonstrate that it outperforms physicians from
the MIMIC-III dataset.

    <title>A Framework for Multi-modal Learning: Jointly Modeling Inter- &amp;
  Intra-Modality Dependencies</title>
    <summary>  Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a
target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in
isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between
different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the
relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these
conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality
dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning
problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a
source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that
end, we propose inter- &amp; intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which
captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies,
leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world
healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models,
demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on
one type of modality dependency.

    <title>Federated Learning on Edge Sensing Devices: A Review</title>
    <summary>  The ability to monitor ambient characteristics, interact with them, and
derive information about the surroundings has been made possible by the rapid
proliferation of edge sensing devices like IoT, mobile, and wearable devices
and their measuring capabilities with integrated sensors. Even though these
devices are small and have less capacity for data storage and processing, they
produce vast amounts of data. Some example application areas where sensor data
is collected and processed include healthcare, environmental (including air
quality and pollution levels), automotive, industrial, aerospace, and
agricultural applications. These enormous volumes of sensing data collected
from the edge devices are analyzed using a variety of Machine Learning (ML) and
Deep Learning (DL) approaches. However, analyzing them on the cloud or a server
presents challenges related to privacy, hardware, and connectivity limitations.
Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a solution to these problems while
preserving privacy by jointly training a model without sharing raw data. In
this paper, we review the FL strategies from the perspective of edge sensing
devices to get over the limitations of conventional machine learning
techniques. We focus on the key FL principles, software frameworks, and
testbeds. We also explore the current sensor technologies, properties of the
sensing devices and sensing applications where FL is utilized. We conclude with
a discussion on open issues and future research directions on FL for further
studies

    <title>Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Time-varying
  Feature Settings</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning methods often assume input features are available at no
cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be
expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost
against its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which
features to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an
AFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a
distribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift,
we present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation
(AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating
that acquisitions don't affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no
unobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature
acquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one
can apply offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption and missing
data methods under the NDE assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a
novel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework, which requires a weaker
positivity assumption and yields more data-efficient estimators. We introduce
three novel estimators: a direct method (DM), an inverse probability weighting
(IPW), and a double reinforcement learning (DRL) estimator.

    <title>Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have
achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their
accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they
make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes
decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models
(NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent
intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination
of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks
are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between
their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and
classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used
intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees.
They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models
in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets
instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for
multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to
their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows
them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.

    <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Audio-Based Emotion Recognition</title>
    <summary>  Emotion recognition models using audio input data can enable the development
of interactive systems with applications in mental healthcare, marketing,
gaming, and social media analysis. While the field of affective computing using
audio data is rich, a major barrier to achieve consistently high-performance
models is the paucity of available training labels. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) is a family of methods which can learn despite a scarcity of supervised
labels by predicting properties of the data itself. To understand the utility
of self-supervised learning for audio-based emotion recognition, we have
applied self-supervised learning pre-training to the classification of emotions
from the CMU- MOSEI's acoustic modality. Unlike prior papers that have
experimented with raw acoustic data, our technique has been applied to encoded
acoustic data. Our model is first pretrained to uncover the randomly-masked
timestamps of the acoustic data. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned using
a small sample of annotated data. The performance of the final model is then
evaluated via several evaluation metrics against a baseline deep learning model
with an identical backbone architecture. We find that self-supervised learning
consistently improves the performance of the model across all metrics. This
work shows the utility of self-supervised learning for affective computing,
demonstrating that self-supervised learning is most useful when the number of
training examples is small, and that the effect is most pronounced for emotions
which are easier to classify such as happy, sad and anger. This work further
demonstrates that self-supervised learning works when applied to embedded
feature representations rather than the traditional approach of pre-training on
the raw input space.

    <title>Machine Learning Against Cancer: Accurate Diagnosis of Cancer by Machine
  Learning Classification of the Whole Genome Sequencing Data</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning can precisely identify different cancer tumors at any stage
by classifying cancerous and healthy samples based on their genomic profile. We
have developed novel methods of MLAC (Machine Learning Against Cancer)
achieving perfect results with perfect precision, sensitivity, and specificity.
We have used the whole genome sequencing data acquired by next-generation RNA
sequencing techniques in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression
projects for cancerous and healthy tissues respectively. Moreover, we have
shown that unsupervised machine learning clustering has great potential to be
used for cancer diagnosis. Indeed, a creative way to work with data and general
algorithms has resulted in perfect classification i.e. all precision,
sensitivity, and specificity are equal to 1 for most of the different tumor
types even with a modest amount of data, and the same method works well on a
series of cancers and results in great clustering of cancerous and healthy
samples too. Our system can be used in practice because once the classifier is
trained, it can be used to classify any new sample of new potential patients.
One advantage of our work is that the aforementioned perfect precision and
recall are obtained on samples of all stages including very early stages of
cancer; therefore, it is a promising tool for diagnosis of cancers in early
stages. Another advantage of our novel model is that it works with normalized
values of RNA sequencing data, hence people's private sensitive medical data
will remain hidden, protected, and safe. This type of analysis will be
widespread and economical in the future and people can even learn to receive
their RNA sequencing data and do their own preliminary cancer studies
themselves which have the potential to help the healthcare systems. It is a
great step forward toward good health that is the main base of sustainable
societies.

    <title>Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted
  by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)</title>
    <summary>  This work summarizes the results of the largest skin image analysis challenge
in the world, hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), a
global partnership that has organized the world's largest public repository of
dermoscopic images of skin. The challenge was hosted in 2018 at the Medical
Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference in
Granada, Spain. The dataset included over 12,500 images across 3 tasks. 900
users registered for data download, 115 submitted to the lesion segmentation
task, 25 submitted to the lesion attribute detection task, and 159 submitted to
the disease classification task. Novel evaluation protocols were established,
including a new test for segmentation algorithm performance, and a test for
algorithm ability to generalize. Results show that top segmentation algorithms
still fail on over 10% of images on average, and algorithms with equal
performance on test data can have different abilities to generalize. This is an
important consideration for agencies regulating the growing set of machine
learning tools in the healthcare domain, and sets a new standard for future
public challenges in healthcare.

    <title>Markov Chain-based Cost-Optimal Control Charts for Healthcare Data</title>
    <summary>  Control charts have traditionally been used in industrial statistics, but are
constantly seeing new areas of application, especially in the age of Industry
4.0. This paper introduces a new method, which is suitable for applications in
the healthcare sector, especially for monitoring a health-characteristic of a
patient. We adapt a Markov chain-based approach and develop a method in which
not only the shift size (i.e. the degradation of the patient's health) can be
random, but the effect of the repair (i.e. treatment) and time between
samplings (i.e. visits) too. This means that we do not use many often-present
assumptions which are usually not applicable for medical treatments. The
average cost of the protocol, which is determined by the time between samplings
and the control limit, can be estimated using the stationary distribution of
the Markov chain.
  Furthermore, we incorporate the standard deviation of the cost into the
optimisation procedure, which is often very important from a process control
viewpoint. The sensitivity of the optimal parameters and the resulting average
cost and cost standard deviation on different parameter values is investigated.
We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for real-life data of patients
treated in Hungary: namely the monitoring of cholesterol level of patients with
cardiovascular event risk. The results showed that the optimal parameters from
our approach can be somewhat different from the original medical parameters.

    <title>Regional medical inter-institutional cooperation in medical provider
  network constructed using patient claims data from Japan</title>
    <summary>  The aging world population requires a sustainable and high-quality healthcare
system. To examine the efficiency of medical cooperation, medical provider and
physician networks were constructed using patient claims data. Previous studies
have shown that these networks contain information on medical cooperation.
However, the usage patterns of multiple medical providers in a series of
medical services have not been considered. In addition, these studies used only
general network features to represent medical cooperation, but their expressive
ability was low. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the medical
provider network to examine its overall contribution to the quality of
healthcare provided by cooperation between medical providers in a series of
medical services. This study focused on: i) the method of feature extraction
from the network, ii) incorporation of the usage pattern of medical providers,
and iii) expressive ability of the statistical model. Femoral neck fractures
were selected as the target disease. To build the medical provider networks, we
analyzed the patient claims data from a single prefecture in Japan between
January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We considered four types of models: a
model using node strength and linear regression to a model using feature
representation by node2vec and regression tree ensemble, which is a machine
learning method. The results showed that a stronger medical provider reduces
the duration of hospital stay. The overall contribution of the medical
cooperation to the duration of hospital stay extracted from the medical
provider network using node2vec is approximately 20%, which is approximately 20
times higher than the model using strength.

    <title>Forecasting User Interests Through Topic Tag Predictions in Online
  Health Communities</title>
    <summary>  The increasing reliance on online communities for healthcare information by
patients and caregivers has led to the increase in the spread of
misinformation, or subjective, anecdotal and inaccurate or non-specific
recommendations, which, if acted on, could cause serious harm to the patients.
Hence, there is an urgent need to connect users with accurate and tailored
health information in a timely manner to prevent such harm. This paper proposes
an innovative approach to suggesting reliable information to participants in
online communities as they move through different stages in their disease or
treatment. We hypothesize that patients with similar histories of disease
progression or course of treatment would have similar information needs at
comparable stages. Specifically, we pose the problem of predicting topic tags
or keywords that describe the future information needs of users based on their
profiles, traces of their online interactions within the community (past posts,
replies) and the profiles and traces of online interactions of other users with
similar profiles and similar traces of past interaction with the target users.
The result is a variant of the collaborative information filtering or
recommendation system tailored to the needs of users of online health
communities. We report results of our experiments on an expert curated data set
which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state of
the art baselines with respect to accurate and timely prediction of topic tags
(and hence information sources of interest).

    <title>Semantic match: Debugging feature attribution methods in XAI for
  healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The recent spike in certified Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for
healthcare has renewed the debate around adoption of this technology. One
thread of such debate concerns Explainable AI (XAI) and its promise to render
AI devices more transparent and trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical
AI space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI
techniques and especially feature attribution methods, questioning their use
and inclusion in guidelines and standards. Despite valid concerns, we argue
that existing criticism on the viability of post-hoc local explainability
methods throws away the baby with the bathwater by generalizing a problem that
is specific to image data. We begin by characterizing the problem as a lack of
semantic match between explanations and human understanding. To understand when
feature importance can be used reliably, we introduce a distinction between
feature importance of low- and high-level features. We argue that for data
types where low-level features come endowed with a clear semantics, such as
tabular data like Electronic Health Records (EHRs), semantic match can be
obtained, and thus feature attribution methods can still be employed in a
meaningful and useful way. Finally, we sketch a procedure to test whether
semantic match has been achieved.

    <title>Understanding how the use of AI decision support tools affect critical
  thinking and over-reliance on technology by drug dispensers in Tanzania</title>
    <summary>  The use of AI in healthcare is designed to improve care delivery and augment
the decisions of providers to enhance patient outcomes. When deployed in
clinical settings, the interaction between providers and AI is a critical
component for measuring and understanding the effectiveness of these digital
tools on broader health outcomes. Even in cases where AI algorithms have high
diagnostic accuracy, healthcare providers often still rely on their experience
and sometimes gut feeling to make a final decision. Other times, providers rely
unquestioningly on the outputs of the AI models, which leads to a concern about
over-reliance on the technology. The purpose of this research was to understand
how reliant drug shop dispensers were on AI-powered technologies when
determining a differential diagnosis for a presented clinical case vignette. We
explored how the drug dispensers responded to technology that is framed as
always correct in an attempt to measure whether they begin to rely on it
without any critical thought of their own. We found that dispensers relied on
the decision made by the AI 25 percent of the time, even when the AI provided
no explanation for its decision.

    <title>FraudAuditor: A Visual Analytics Approach for Collusive Fraud in Health
  Insurance</title>
    <summary>  Collusive fraud, in which multiple fraudsters collude to defraud health
insurance funds, threatens the operation of the healthcare system. However,
existing statistical and machine learning-based methods have limited ability to
detect fraud in the scenario of health insurance due to the high similarity of
fraudulent behaviors to normal medical visits and the lack of labeled data. To
ensure the accuracy of the detection results, expert knowledge needs to be
integrated with the fraud detection process. By working closely with health
insurance audit experts, we propose FraudAuditor, a three-stage visual
analytics approach to collusive fraud detection in health insurance.
Specifically, we first allow users to interactively construct a co-visit
network to holistically model the visit relationships of different patients.
Second, an improved community detection algorithm that considers the strength
of fraud likelihood is designed to detect suspicious fraudulent groups.
Finally, through our visual interface, users can compare, investigate, and
verify suspicious patient behavior with tailored visualizations that support
different time scales. We conducted case studies in a real-world healthcare
scenario, i.e., to help locate the actual fraud group and exclude the false
positive group. The results and expert feedback proved the effectiveness and
usability of the approach.

    <title>The Potential and Pitfalls of using a Large Language Model such as
  ChatGPT or GPT-4 as a Clinical Assistant</title>
    <summary>  Recent studies have demonstrated promising performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4
on several medical domain tasks. However, none have assessed its performance
using a large-scale real-world electronic health record database, nor have
evaluated its utility in providing clinical diagnostic assistance for patients
across a full range of disease presentation. We performed two analyses using
ChatGPT and GPT-4, one to identify patients with specific medical diagnoses
using a real-world large electronic health record database and the other, in
providing diagnostic assistance to healthcare workers in the prospective
evaluation of hypothetical patients. Our results show that GPT-4 across disease
classification tasks with chain of thought and few-shot prompting can achieve
performance as high as 96% F1 scores. For patient assessment, GPT-4 can
accurately diagnose three out of four times. However, there were mentions of
factually incorrect statements, overlooking crucial medical findings,
recommendations for unnecessary investigations and overtreatment. These issues
coupled with privacy concerns, make these models currently inadequate for real
world clinical use. However, limited data and time needed for prompt
engineering in comparison to configuration of conventional machine learning
workflows highlight their potential for scalability across healthcare
applications.

    <title>Smart Home Goal Feature Model -- A guide to support Smart Homes for
  Ageing in Place</title>
    <summary>  Smart technologies are significant in supporting ageing in place for elderly.
Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it provides
peace of mind, enabling the elderly to continue living independently. Elderly
use smart technologies for entertainment and social interactions, this can be
extended to provide safety and monitor health and environmental conditions,
detect emergencies and notify informal and formal caregivers when care is
needed. This paper provides an overview of the smart home technologies
commercially available to support ageing in place, the advantages and
challenges of smart home technologies, and their usability from elderlys
perspective. Synthesizing prior knowledge, we created a structured Smart Home
Goal Feature Model (SHGFM) to resolve heuristic approaches used by the Subject
Matter Experts (SMEs) at aged care facilities and healthcare researchers in
adapting smart homes. The SHGFM provides SMEs the ability to (i) establish
goals and (ii) identify features to set up strategies to design, develop and
deploy smart homes for the elderly based on personalised needs. Our model
provides guidance to healthcare researchers and aged care industries to set up
smart homes based on the needs of elderly, by defining a set of goals at
different levels mapped to a different set of features.

    <title>Copycats: the many lives of a publicly available medical imaging dataset</title>
    <summary>  Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

    <title>Group-Sparse Matrix Factorization for Transfer Learning of Word
  Embeddings</title>
    <summary>  Unstructured text provides decision-makers with a rich data source in many
domains, ranging from product reviews in retail to nursing notes in healthcare.
To leverage this information, words are typically translated into word
embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words --
through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization. However,
learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data can be
challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new domain,
e.g., the word ``positive'' typically has positive sentiment, but often has
negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient tested
positive for a disease. In practice, we expect that only a small number of
domain-specific words may have new meanings. We propose an intuitive two-stage
estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our transfer learning estimator,
proving that it can achieve high accuracy with substantially less
domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings are altered between
domains. Furthermore, we prove that all local minima identified by our
nonconvex objective function are statistically indistinguishable from the
global minimum under standard regularization conditions, implying that our
estimator can be computed efficiently. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We
empirically evaluate our approach compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning
heuristics from natural language processing.

    <title>Benchmarking Collaborative Learning Methods Cost-Effectiveness for
  Prostate Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data is often split into medium/small-sized collections across
multiple hospitals and access to it is encumbered by privacy regulations. This
brings difficulties to use them for the development of machine learning and
deep learning models, which are known to be data-hungry. One way to overcome
this limitation is to use collaborative learning (CL) methods, which allow
hospitals to work collaboratively to solve a task, without the need to
explicitly share local data.
  In this paper, we address a prostate segmentation problem from MRI in a
collaborative scenario by comparing two different approaches: federated
learning (FL) and consensus-based methods (CBM).
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which CBM, such as
label fusion techniques, are used to solve a problem of collaborative learning.
In this setting, CBM combine predictions from locally trained models to obtain
a federated strong learner with ideally improved robustness and predictive
variance properties.
  Our experiments show that, in the considered practical scenario, CBMs provide
equal or better results than FL, while being highly cost-effective. Our results
demonstrate that the consensus paradigm may represent a valid alternative to FL
for typical training tasks in medical imaging.

    <title>Artificial Inductive Bias for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation in
  Data-Scarce Scenarios</title>
    <summary>  While synthetic tabular data generation using Deep Generative Models (DGMs)
offers a compelling solution to data scarcity and privacy concerns, their
effectiveness relies on substantial training data, often unavailable in
real-world applications. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a
novel methodology for generating realistic and reliable synthetic tabular data
with DGMs in limited real-data environments. Our approach proposes several ways
to generate an artificial inductive bias in a DGM through transfer learning and
meta-learning techniques. We explore and compare four different methods within
this framework, demonstrating that transfer learning strategies like
pre-training and model averaging outperform meta-learning approaches, like
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, and Domain Randomized Search. We validate our
approach using two state-of-the-art DGMs, namely, a Variational Autoencoder and
a Generative Adversarial Network, to show that our artificial inductive bias
fuels superior synthetic data quality, as measured by Jensen-Shannon
divergence, achieving relative gains of up to 50\% when using our proposed
approach. This methodology has broad applicability in various DGMs and machine
learning tasks, particularly in areas like healthcare and finance, where data
scarcity is often a critical issue.

    <title>Detecting weak changes in dynamic events over networks</title>
    <summary>  Large volume of networked streaming event data are becoming increasingly
available in a wide variety of applications, such as social network analysis,
Internet traffic monitoring and healthcare analytics. Streaming event data are
discrete observation occurred in continuous time, and the precise time interval
between two events carries a great deal of information about the dynamics of
the underlying systems. How to promptly detect changes in these dynamic systems
using these streaming event data? In this paper, we propose a novel
change-point detection framework for multi-dimensional event data over
networks. We cast the problem into sequential hypothesis test, and derive the
likelihood ratios for point processes, which are computed efficiently via an
EM-like algorithm that is parameter-free and can be computed in a distributed
fashion. We derive a highly accurate theoretical characterization of the
false-alarm-rate, and show that it can achieve weak signal detection by
aggregating local statistics over time and networks. Finally, we demonstrate
the good performance of our algorithm on numerical examples and real-world
datasets from twitter and Memetracker.

    <title>Deep Survival Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The electronic health record (EHR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to
build actionable tools to support physicians at the point of care. In this
paper, we investigate survival analysis in the context of EHR data. We
introduce deep survival analysis, a hierarchical generative approach to
survival analysis. It departs from previous approaches in two primary ways: (1)
all observations, including covariates, are modeled jointly conditioned on a
rich latent structure; and (2) the observations are aligned by their failure
time, rather than by an arbitrary time zero as in traditional survival
analysis. Further, it (3) scalably handles heterogeneous (continuous and
discrete) data types that occur in the EHR. We validate deep survival analysis
model by stratifying patients according to risk of developing coronary heart
disease (CHD). Specifically, we study a dataset of 313,000 patients
corresponding to 5.5 million months of observations. When compared to the
clinically validated Framingham CHD risk score, deep survival analysis is
significantly superior in stratifying patients according to their risk.

    <title>Towards unstructured mortality prediction with free-text clinical notes</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare data continues to flourish yet a relatively small portion, mostly
structured, is being utilized effectively for predicting clinical outcomes. The
rich subjective information available in unstructured clinical notes can
possibly facilitate higher discrimination but tends to be under-utilized in
mortality prediction. This work attempts to assess the gain in performance when
multiple notes that have been minimally preprocessed are used as an input for
prediction. A hierarchical architecture consisting of both convolutional and
recurrent layers is used to concurrently model the different notes compiled in
an individual hospital stay. This approach is evaluated on predicting
in-hospital mortality on the MIMIC-III dataset. On comparison to approaches
utilizing structured data, it achieved higher metrics despite requiring less
cleaning and preprocessing. This demonstrates the potential of unstructured
data in enhancing mortality prediction and signifies the need to incorporate
more raw unstructured data into current clinical prediction methods.

    <title>RDIS: Random Drop Imputation with Self-Training for Incomplete Time
  Series Data</title>
    <summary>  Time-series data with missing values are commonly encountered in many fields,
such as healthcare, meteorology, and robotics. The imputation aims to fill the
missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models
implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we
propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training
method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra
missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete
data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly
dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to
exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values,
we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the
effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various
imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.

    <title>Are Your Explanations Reliable? Investigating the Stability of LIME in
  Explaining Text Classifiers by Marrying XAI and Adversarial Attack</title>
    <summary>  LIME has emerged as one of the most commonly referenced tools in explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that is integrated into critical machine learning
applications--e.g., healthcare and finance. However, its stability remains
little explored, especially in the context of text data, due to the unique
text-space constraints. To address these challenges, in this paper, we first
evaluate the inherent instability of LIME on text data to establish a baseline,
and then propose a novel algorithm XAIFooler to perturb text inputs and
manipulate explanations that casts investigation on the stability of LIME as a
text perturbation optimization problem. XAIFooler conforms to the constraints
to preserve text semantics and original prediction with small perturbations,
and introduces Rank-biased Overlap (RBO) as a key part to guide the
optimization of XAIFooler that satisfies all the requirements for explanation
similarity measure. Extensive experiments on real-world text datasets
demonstrate that XAIFooler significantly outperforms all baselines by large
margins in its ability to manipulate LIME's explanations with high semantic
preservability.

    <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Shapley values in a Clinical Context</title>
    <summary>  With the adoption of machine learning-based solutions in routine clinical
practice, the need for reliable interpretability tools has become pressing.
Shapley values provide local explanations. The method gained popularity in
recent years. Here, we reveal current misconceptions about the ``true to the
data'' or ``true to the model'' trade-off and demonstrate its importance in a
clinical context. We show that the interpretation of Shapley values, which
strongly depends on the choice of a reference distribution for modeling feature
removal, is often misunderstood. We further advocate that for applications in
medicine, the reference distribution should be tailored to the underlying
clinical question. Finally, we advise on the right reference distributions for
specific medical use cases.

    <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Classifying Gene Mutations in Cancer
  using LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe</title>
    <summary>  In our study, we introduce a novel hybrid ensemble model that synergistically
combines LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe embeddings for the classification of
gene mutations in cancer. This model was rigorously tested using Kaggle's
Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment dataset, demonstrating
exceptional performance across all evaluation metrics. Notably, our approach
achieved a training accuracy of 80.6%, precision of 81.6%, recall of 80.6%, and
an F1 score of 83.1%, alongside a significantly reduced Mean Squared Error
(MSE) of 2.596. These results surpass those of advanced transformer models and
their ensembles, showcasing our model's superior capability in handling the
complexities of gene mutation classification. The accuracy and efficiency of
gene mutation classification are paramount in the era of precision medicine,
where tailored treatment plans based on individual genetic profiles can
dramatically improve patient outcomes and save lives. Our model's remarkable
performance highlights its potential in enhancing the precision of cancer
diagnoses and treatments, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement
of personalized healthcare.

    <title>A Perspective on Individualized Treatment Effects Estimation from
  Time-series Health Data</title>
    <summary>  The burden of diseases is rising worldwide, with unequal treatment efficacy
for patient populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials.
Healthcare, however, is driven by the average population effect of medical
treatments and, therefore, operates in a "one-size-fits-all" approach, not
necessarily what best fits each patient. These facts suggest a pressing need
for methodologies to study individualized treatment effects (ITE) to drive
personalized treatment. Despite the increased interest in
machine-learning-driven ITE estimation models, the vast majority focus on
tabular data with limited review and understanding of methodologies proposed
for time-series electronic health records (EHRs). To this end, this work
provides an overview of ITE works for time-series data and insights into future
research. The work summarizes the latest work in the literature and reviews it
in light of theoretical assumptions, types of treatment settings, and
computational frameworks. Furthermore, this work discusses challenges and
future research directions for ITEs in a time-series setting. We hope this work
opens new directions and serves as a resource for understanding one of the
exciting yet under-studied research areas.

    <title>Developing a New Autism Diagnosis Process Based on a Hybrid Deep
  Learning Architecture Through Analyzing Home Videos</title>
    <summary>  Currently, every 1 in 54 children have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD), which is 178% higher than it was in 2000. An early diagnosis
and treatment can significantly increase the chances of going off the spectrum
and making a full recovery. With a multitude of physical and behavioral tests
for neurological and communication skills, diagnosing ASD is very complex,
subjective, time-consuming, and expensive. We hypothesize that the use of
machine learning analysis on facial features and social behavior can speed up
the diagnosis of ASD without compromising real-world performance. We propose to
develop a hybrid architecture using both categorical data and image data to
automate traditional ASD pre-screening, which makes diagnosis a quicker and
easier process. We created and tested a Logistic Regression model and a Linear
Support Vector Machine for Module 1, which classifies ADOS categorical data. A
Convolutional Neural Network and a DenseNet network are used for module 2,
which classifies video data. Finally, we combined the best performing models, a
Linear SVM and DenseNet, using three data averaging strategies. We used a
standard average, weighted based on number of training data, and weighted based
on the number of ASD patients in the training data to average the results,
thereby increasing accuracy in clinical applications. The results we obtained
support our hypothesis. Our novel architecture is able to effectively automate
ASD pre-screening with a maximum weighted accuracy of 84%.

    <title>Robustness against the channel effect in pathological voice detection</title>
    <summary>  Many people are suffering from voice disorders, which can adversely affect
the quality of their lives. In response, some researchers have proposed
algorithms for automatic assessment of these disorders, based on voice signals.
However, these signals can be sensitive to the recording devices. Indeed, the
channel effect is a pervasive problem in machine learning for healthcare. In
this study, we propose a detection system for pathological voice, which is
robust against the channel effect. This system is based on a bidirectional LSTM
network. To increase the performance robustness against channel mismatch, we
integrate domain adversarial training (DAT) to eliminate the differences
between the devices. When we train on data recorded on a high-quality
microphone and evaluate on smartphone data without labels, our robust detection
system increases the PR-AUC from 0.8448 to 0.9455 (and 0.9522 with target
sample labels). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying
unsupervised domain adaptation to pathological voice detection. Notably, our
system does not need target device sample labels, which allows for
generalization to many new devices.

    <title>Machine learning for automatic construction of pseudo-realistic
  pediatric abdominal phantoms</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) is proving extremely beneficial in many healthcare
applications. In pediatric oncology, retrospective studies that investigate the
relationship between treatment and late adverse effects still rely on simple
heuristics. To assess the effects of radiation therapy, treatment plans are
typically simulated on phantoms, i.e., virtual surrogates of patient anatomy.
Currently, phantoms are built according to reasonable, yet simple,
human-designed criteria. This often results in a lack of individualization. We
present a novel approach that combines imaging and ML to build individualized
phantoms automatically. Given the features of a patient treated historically
(only 2D radiographs available), and a database of 3D Computed Tomography (CT)
imaging with organ segmentations and relative patient features, our approach
uses ML to predict how to assemble a patient-specific phantom automatically.
Experiments on 60 abdominal CTs of pediatric patients show that our approach
constructs significantly more representative phantoms than using current
phantom building criteria, in terms of location and shape of the abdomen and of
two considered organs, the liver and the spleen. Among several ML algorithms
considered, the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm for Genetic
Programming (GP-GOMEA) is found to deliver the best performing models, which
are, moreover, transparent and interpretable mathematical expressions.

    <title>On the Explanation of Machine Learning Predictions in Clinical Gait
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to support decision-making in the
healthcare sector. While ML approaches provide promising results with regard to
their classification performance, most share a central limitation, namely their
black-box character. Motivated by the interest to understand the functioning of
ML models, methods from the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
have recently become important. This article investigates the usefulness of XAI
methods in clinical gait classification. For this purpose, predictions of
state-of-the-art classification methods are explained with an established XAI
method, i.e., Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). We propose to evaluate
the obtained explanations with two complementary approaches: a statistical
analysis of the underlying data using Statistical Parametric Mapping and a
qualitative evaluation by a clinical expert. A gait dataset comprising ground
reaction force measurements from 132 patients with different lower-body gait
disorders and 62 healthy controls is utilized. We investigate several gait
classification tasks, employ multiple classification methods, and analyze the
impact of data normalization and different signal components for classification
performance and explanation quality. Our experiments show that explanations
obtained by LRP exhibit promising statistical properties concerning inter-class
discriminativity and are also in line with clinically relevant biomechanical
gait characteristics.

    <title>Interpretability by design using computer vision for behavioral sensing
  in child and adolescent psychiatry</title>
    <summary>  Observation is an essential tool for understanding and studying human
behavior and mental states. However, coding human behavior is a time-consuming,
expensive task, in which reliability can be difficult to achieve and bias is a
risk. Machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to improve reliability, decrease
cost, and scale up behavioral coding for application in clinical and research
settings. Here, we use computer vision to derive behavioral codes or concepts
of a gold standard behavioral rating system, offering familiar interpretation
for mental health professionals. Features were extracted from videos of
clinical diagnostic interviews of children and adolescents with and without
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our computationally-derived ratings were
comparable to human expert ratings for negative emotions,
activity-level/arousal and anxiety. For the attention and positive affect
concepts, our ML ratings performed reasonably. However, results for gaze and
vocalization indicate a need for improved data quality or additional data
modalities.

    <title>MobileCaps: A Lightweight Model for Screening and Severity Analysis of
  COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  The world is going through a challenging phase due to the disastrous effect
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and the economy. The
rate of spreading, post-COVID-19 symptoms, and the occurrence of new strands of
COVID-19 have put the healthcare systems in disruption across the globe. Due to
this, the task of accurately screening COVID-19 cases has become of utmost
priority. Since the virus infects the respiratory system, Chest X-Ray is an
imaging modality that is adopted extensively for the initial screening. We have
performed a comprehensive study that uses CXR images to identify COVID-19 cases
and realized the necessity of having a more generalizable model. We utilize
MobileNetV2 architecture as the feature extractor and integrate it into Capsule
Networks to construct a fully automated and lightweight model termed as
MobileCaps. MobileCaps is trained and evaluated on the publicly available
dataset with the model ensembling and Bayesian optimization strategies to
efficiently classify CXR images of patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19
pneumonia and healthy cases. The proposed model is further evaluated on two
additional RT-PCR confirmed datasets to demonstrate the generalizability. We
also introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity assessment
of CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema
(RALE) scoring technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall
of 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively. Further, the severity
assessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact that
the proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art
models reported in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in
aiding healthcare systems in the battle against the pandemic.

    <title>It's FLAN time! Summing feature-wise latent representations for
  interpretability</title>
    <summary>  Interpretability has become a necessary feature for machine learning models
deployed in critical scenarios, e.g. legal system, healthcare. In these
situations, algorithmic decisions may have (potentially negative) long-lasting
effects on the end-user affected by the decision. In many cases, the
representational power of deep learning models is not needed, therefore simple
and interpretable models (e.g. linear models) should be preferred. However, in
high-dimensional and/or complex domains (e.g. computer vision), the universal
approximation capabilities of neural networks are required. Inspired by linear
models and the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a novel
class of structurally-constrained neural networks, which we call FLANs
(Feature-wise Latent Additive Networks). Crucially, FLANs process each input
feature separately, computing for each of them a representation in a common
latent space. These feature-wise latent representations are then simply summed,
and the aggregated representation is used for prediction. These constraints
(which are at the core of the interpretability of linear models) allow a user
to estimate the effect of each individual feature independently from the
others, enhancing interpretability. In a set of experiments across different
domains, we show how without compromising excessively the test performance, the
structural constraints proposed in FLANs indeed facilitates the
interpretability of deep learning models. We quantitatively compare FLANs
interpretability to post-hoc methods using recently introduced metrics,
discussing the advantages of natively interpretable models over a post-hoc
analysis.

    <title>Natural Learning</title>
    <summary>  We introduce Natural Learning (NL), a novel algorithm that elevates the
explainability and interpretability of machine learning to an extreme level. NL
simplifies decisions into intuitive rules, like "We rejected your loan because
your income, employment status, and age collectively resemble a rejected
prototype more than an accepted prototype." When applied to real-life datasets,
NL produces impressive results. For example, in a colon cancer dataset with
1545 patients and 10935 genes, NL achieves 98.1% accuracy, comparable to DNNs
and RF, by analyzing just 3 genes of test samples against 2 discovered
prototypes. Similarly, in the UCI's WDBC dataset, NL achieves 98.3% accuracy
using only 7 features and 2 prototypes. Even on the MNIST dataset (0 vs. 1), NL
achieves 99.5% accuracy with only 3 pixels from 2 prototype images. NL is
inspired by prototype theory, an old concept in cognitive psychology suggesting
that people learn single sparse prototypes to categorize objects. Leveraging
this relaxed assumption, we redesign Support Vector Machines (SVM), replacing
its mathematical formulation with a fully nearest-neighbor-based solution, and
to address the curse of dimensionality, we utilize locality-sensitive hashing.
Following theory's generalizability principle, we propose a recursive method to
prune non-core features. As a result, NL efficiently discovers the sparsest
prototypes in O(n^2pL) with high parallelization capacity in terms of n.
Evaluation of NL with 17 benchmark datasets shows its significant
outperformance compared to decision trees and logistic regression, two methods
widely favored in healthcare for their interpretability. Moreover, NL achieves
performance comparable to finetuned black-box models such as deep neural
networks and random forests in 40% of cases, with only a 1-2% lower average
accuracy. The code is available via http://natural-learning.cc.

    <title>CARRNN: A Continuous Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network for Deep
  Representation Learning from Sporadic Temporal Data</title>
    <summary>  Learning temporal patterns from multivariate longitudinal data is challenging
especially in cases when data is sporadic, as often seen in, e.g., healthcare
applications where the data can suffer from irregularity and asynchronicity as
the time between consecutive data points can vary across features and samples,
hindering the application of existing deep learning models that are constructed
for complete, evenly spaced data with fixed sequence lengths. In this paper, a
novel deep learning-based model is developed for modeling multiple temporal
features in sporadic data using an integrated deep learning architecture based
on a recurrent neural network (RNN) unit and a continuous-time autoregressive
(CAR) model. The proposed model, called CARRNN, uses a generalized
discrete-time autoregressive model that is trainable end-to-end using neural
networks modulated by time lags to describe the changes caused by the
irregularity and asynchronicity. It is applied to multivariate time-series
regression tasks using data provided for Alzheimer's disease progression
modeling and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate prediction, where the
proposed model based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) achieves the lowest
prediction errors among the proposed RNN-based models and state-of-the-art
methods using GRUs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in their
architecture.

    <title>NeuCrowd: Neural Sampling Network for Representation Learning with
  Crowdsourced Labels</title>
    <summary>  Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative
training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare,
smart city, education, etc. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get
annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation,
shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels is
still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators' diverse expertise,
crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing
supervised representation learning (SRL) algorithms may easily get the
overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose
\emph{NeuCrowd}, a unified framework for SRL from crowdsourced labels. The
proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality
\emph{n}-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust
anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that
adaptively learns to select effective samples for SRL networks. The proposed
framework is evaluated on both one synthetic and three real-world data sets.
The results show that our approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC. To encourage reproducible
results, we make our code publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/tal-ai/NeuCrowd_KAIS2021}.

    <title>Borrowing Treasures from Neighbors: In-Context Learning for Multimodal
  Learning with Missing Modalities and Data Scarcity</title>
    <summary>  Multimodal machine learning with missing modalities is an increasingly
relevant challenge arising in various applications such as healthcare. This
paper extends the current research into missing modalities to the low-data
regime, i.e., a downstream task has both missing modalities and limited sample
size issues. This problem setting is particularly challenging and also
practical as it is often expensive to get full-modality data and sufficient
annotated training samples. We propose to use retrieval-augmented in-context
learning to address these two crucial issues by unleashing the potential of a
transformer's in-context learning ability. Diverging from existing methods,
which primarily belong to the parametric paradigm and often require sufficient
training samples, our work exploits the value of the available full-modality
data, offering a novel perspective on resolving the challenge. The proposed
data-dependent framework exhibits a higher degree of sample efficiency and is
empirically demonstrated to enhance the classification model's performance on
both full- and missing-modality data in the low-data regime across various
multimodal learning tasks. When only 1% of the training data are available, our
proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of 6.1% over a recent
strong baseline across various datasets and missing states. Notably, our method
also reduces the performance gap between full-modality and missing-modality
data compared with the baseline.

    <title>Tracking Results and Utilization of Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in
  Radiology: Early-Stage COVID-19 Pandemic Observations</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of
Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking both large-scale
utilization and AI results data, the tru-AI approach is designed to calculate
surrogates for measuring important disease-related observational quantities
over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during the
COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical
applicability of the tru-AI approach, we analyzed service requests for
automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT using a
commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based
prioritization of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in
patients with emergent clinical findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism.We
analyzed data of N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies at a
major US healthcare system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020,
and compared two observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from
November 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the
COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1-30, 2020. Results: Although daily CT scan
counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/-
7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be observed by
AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p&lt;0.05), with approximately one
daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected. Conclusion: Our results
suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data in
radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile
exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects
on healthcare.

    <title>Word Embedding Neural Networks to Advance Knee Osteoarthritis Research</title>
    <summary>  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease worldwide,
where knee OA takes more than 80% of commonly affected joints. Knee OA is not a
curable disease yet, and it affects large columns of patients, making it costly
to patients and healthcare systems. Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of knee
OA might be argued by variability in its clinical and physical manifestations.
Although knee OA carries a list of well-known terminology aiming to standardize
the nomenclature of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes
of the chronic joint disease, in practice there is a wide range of terminology
associated with knee OA across different data sources, including but not
limited to biomedical literature, clinical notes, healthcare literacy, and
health-related social media. Among these data sources, the scientific articles
published in the biomedical literature usually make a principled pipeline to
study disease. Rapid yet, accurate text mining on large-scale scientific
literature may discover novel knowledge and terminology to better understand
knee OA and to improve the quality of knee OA diagnosis, prevention, and
treatment. The present works aim to utilize artificial neural network
strategies to automatically extract vocabularies associated with knee OA
diseases. Our finding indicates the feasibility of developing word embedding
neural networks for autonomous keyword extraction and abstraction of knee OA.

    <title>Counterfactual Prediction Under Outcome Measurement Error</title>
    <summary>  Across domains such as medicine, employment, and criminal justice, predictive
models often target labels that imperfectly reflect the outcomes of interest to
experts and policymakers. For example, clinical risk assessments deployed to
inform physician decision-making often predict measures of healthcare
utilization (e.g., costs, hospitalization) as a proxy for patient medical need.
These proxies can be subject to outcome measurement error when they
systematically differ from the target outcome they are intended to measure.
However, prior modeling efforts to characterize and mitigate outcome
measurement error overlook the fact that the decision being informed by a model
often serves as a risk-mitigating intervention that impacts the target outcome
of interest and its recorded proxy. Thus, in these settings, addressing
measurement error requires counterfactual modeling of treatment effects on
outcomes. In this work, we study intersectional threats to model reliability
introduced by outcome measurement error, treatment effects, and selection bias
from historical decision-making policies. We develop an unbiased risk
minimization method which, given knowledge of proxy measurement error
properties, corrects for the combined effects of these challenges. We also
develop a method for estimating treatment-dependent measurement error
parameters when these are unknown in advance. We demonstrate the utility of our
approach theoretically and via experiments on real-world data from randomized
controlled trials conducted in healthcare and employment domains. As
importantly, we demonstrate that models correcting for outcome measurement
error or treatment effects alone suffer from considerable reliability
limitations. Our work underscores the importance of considering intersectional
threats to model validity during the design and evaluation of predictive models
for decision support.

    <title>ECG-QA: A Comprehensive Question Answering Dataset Combined With
  Electrocardiogram</title>
    <summary>  Question answering (QA) in the field of healthcare has received much
attention due to significant advancements in natural language processing.
However, existing healthcare QA datasets primarily focus on medical images,
clinical notes, or structured electronic health record tables. This leaves the
vast potential of combining electrocardiogram (ECG) data with these systems
largely untapped. To address this gap, we present ECG-QA, the first QA dataset
specifically designed for ECG analysis. The dataset comprises a total of 70
question templates that cover a wide range of clinically relevant ECG topics,
each validated by an ECG expert to ensure their clinical utility. As a result,
our dataset includes diverse ECG interpretation questions, including those that
require a comparative analysis of two different ECGs. In addition, we have
conducted numerous experiments to provide valuable insights for future research
directions. We believe that ECG-QA will serve as a valuable resource for the
development of intelligent QA systems capable of assisting clinicians in ECG
interpretations. Dataset URL: https://github.com/Jwoo5/ecg-qa

    <summary>  Doctors often rely on their past experience in order to diagnose patients.
For a doctor with enough experience, almost every patient would have
similarities to key cases seen in the past, and each new patient could be
viewed as a mixture of these key past cases. Because doctors often tend to
reason this way, an efficient computationally aided diagnostic tool that thinks
in the same way might be helpful in locating key past cases of interest that
could assist with diagnosis. This article develops a novel mathematical model
to mimic the type of logical thinking that physicians use when considering past
cases. The proposed model can also provide physicians with explanations that
would be similar to the way they would naturally reason about cases. The
proposed method is designed to yield predictive accuracy, computational
efficiency, and insight into medical data; the key element is the insight into
medical data, in some sense we are automating a complicated process that
physicians might perform manually. We finally implemented the result of this
work on two publicly available healthcare datasets, for heart disease
prediction and breast cancer prediction.

    <title>Stabilizing Sparse Cox Model using Clinical Structures in Electronic
  Medical Records</title>
    <summary>  Stability in clinical prediction models is crucial for transferability
between studies, yet has received little attention. The problem is paramount in
high dimensional data which invites sparse models with feature selection
capability. We introduce an effective method to stabilize sparse Cox model of
time-to-events using clinical structures inherent in Electronic Medical
Records. Model estimation is stabilized using a feature graph derived from two
types of EMR structures: temporal structure of disease and intervention
recurrences, and hierarchical structure of medical knowledge and practices. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the method in predicting time-to-readmission of
heart failure patients. On two stability measures - the Jaccard index and the
Consistency index - the use of clinical structures significantly increased
feature stability without hurting discriminative power. Our model reported a
competitive AUC of 0.64 (95% CIs: [0.58,0.69]) for 6 months prediction.

    <title>Full Law Identification In Graphical Models Of Missing Data:
  Completeness Results</title>
    <summary>  Missing data has the potential to affect analyses conducted in all fields of
scientific study, including healthcare, economics, and the social sciences.
Several approaches to unbiased inference in the presence of non-ignorable
missingness rely on the specification of the target distribution and its
missingness process as a probability distribution that factorizes with respect
to a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we address the longstanding
question of the characterization of models that are identifiable within this
class of missing data distributions. We provide the first completeness result
in this field of study -- necessary and sufficient graphical conditions under
which, the full data distribution can be recovered from the observed data
distribution. We then simultaneously address issues that may arise due to the
presence of both missing data and unmeasured confounding, by extending these
graphical conditions and proofs of completeness, to settings where some
variables are not just missing, but completely unobserved.

    <title>Towards the Unification and Robustness of Perturbation and Gradient
  Based Explanations</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in critical
domains such as healthcare and criminal justice, there has been a growing
emphasis on developing techniques for explaining these black boxes in a post
hoc manner. In this work, we analyze two popular post hoc interpretation
techniques: SmoothGrad which is a gradient based method, and a variant of LIME
which is a perturbation based method. More specifically, we derive explicit
closed form expressions for the explanations output by these two methods and
show that they both converge to the same explanation in expectation, i.e., when
the number of perturbed samples used by these methods is large. We then
leverage this connection to establish other desirable properties, such as
robustness, for these techniques. We also derive finite sample complexity
bounds for the number of perturbations required for these methods to converge
to their expected explanation. Finally, we empirically validate our theory
using extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real world datasets.

    <title>Unremarkable AI: Fitting Intelligent Decision Support into Critical,
  Clinical Decision-Making Processes</title>
    <summary>  Clinical decision support tools (DST) promise improved healthcare outcomes by
offering data-driven insights. While effective in lab settings, almost all DSTs
have failed in practice. Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as
the cause. This paper describes the design and field evaluation of a radically
new form of DST. It automatically generates slides for clinicians' decision
meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics. This design took inspiration
from the notion of "Unremarkable Computing", that by augmenting the users'
routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet remain
unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to
encounter and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses, we discuss the
importance and intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in
DST design, and share lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a
situated experience.

    <title>An AI-Augmented Lesion Detection Framework For Liver Metastases With
  Model Interpretability</title>
    <summary>  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Most CRC deaths are the
result of progression of metastases. The assessment of metastases is done using
the RECIST criterion, which is time consuming and subjective, as clinicians
need to manually measure anatomical tumor sizes. AI has many successes in image
object detection, but often suffers because the models used are not
interpretable, leading to issues in trust and implementation in the clinical
setting. We propose a framework for an AI-augmented system in which an
interactive AI system assists clinicians in the metastasis assessment. We
include model interpretability to give explanations of the reasoning of the
underlying models.

    <title>Prediction of MRI Hardware Failures based on Image Features using Time
  Series Classification</title>
    <summary>  Already before systems malfunction one has to know if hardware components
will fail in near future in order to counteract in time. Thus, unplanned
downtime is ought to be avoided. In medical imaging, maximizing the system's
uptime is crucial for patients' health and healthcare provider's daily
business. We aim to predict failures of Head/Neck coils used in Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) by training a statistical model on sequential data
collected over time. As image features depend on the coil's condition, their
deviations from the normal range already hint to future failure. Thus, we used
image features and their variation over time to predict coil damage. After
comparison of different time series classification methods we found Long Short
Term Memorys (LSTMs) to achieve the highest F-score of 86.43% and to tell with
98.33% accuracy if hardware should be replaced.

    <title>Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Modal Ensembling for Severity Prediction of
  Alzheimer's Dementia</title>
    <summary>  Reliability in Neural Networks (NNs) is crucial in safety-critical
applications like healthcare, and uncertainty estimation is a widely researched
method to highlight the confidence of NNs in deployment. In this work, we
propose an uncertainty-aware boosting technique for multi-modal ensembling to
predict Alzheimer's Dementia Severity. The propagation of uncertainty across
acoustic, cognitive, and linguistic features produces an ensemble system robust
to heteroscedasticity in the data. Weighing the different modalities based on
the uncertainty estimates, we experiment on the benchmark ADReSS dataset, a
subject-independent and balanced dataset, to show that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods while also reducing the overall entropy of the
system. This work aims to encourage fair and aware models. The source code is

    <title>Towards Understanding and Mitigating Social Biases in Language Models</title>
    <summary>  As machine learning methods are deployed in real-world settings such as
healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how
they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making
processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained
language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting
undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from
stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race,
religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness
of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before
proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we
propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our
empirical results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating
bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text
generation, thereby pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

    <title>Releasing Graph Neural Networks with Differential Privacy Guarantees</title>
    <summary>  With the increasing popularity of graph neural networks (GNNs) in several
sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised
over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to
privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only black-box
access to the trained model is granted. We propose PrivGNN, a
privacy-preserving framework for releasing GNN models in a centralized setting.
Assuming an access to a public unlabeled graph, PrivGNN provides a framework to
release GNN models trained explicitly on public data along with knowledge
obtained from the private data in a privacy preserving manner. PrivGNN combines
the knowledge-distillation framework with the two noise mechanisms, random
subsampling, and noisy labeling, to ensure rigorous privacy guarantees. We
theoretically analyze our approach in the Renyi differential privacy framework.
Besides, we show the solid experimental performance of our method compared to
several baselines adapted for graph-structured data. Our code is available at
https://github.com/iyempissy/privGnn.

    <title>Towards Trustworthy Cross-patient Model Development</title>
    <summary>  Machine learning is used in medicine to support physicians in examination,
diagnosis, and predicting outcomes. One of the most dynamic area is the usage
of patient generated health data from intensive care units. The goal of this
paper is to demonstrate how we advance cross-patient ML model development by
combining the patient's demographics data with their physiological data. We
used a population of patients undergoing Carotid Enderarterectomy (CEA), where
we studied differences in model performance and explainability when trained for
all patients and one patient at a time. The results show that patients'
demographics has a large impact on the performance and explainability and thus
trustworthiness. We conclude that we can increase trust in ML models in a
cross-patient context, by careful selection of models and patients based on
their demographics and the surgical procedure.

    <title>AI-based approach for improving the detection of blood doping in sports</title>
    <summary>  Sports officials around the world are facing incredible challenges due to the
unfair means of practices performed by the athletes to improve their
performance in the game. It includes the intake of hormonal based drugs or
transfusion of blood to increase their strength and the result of their
training. However, the current direct test of detection of these cases includes
the laboratory-based method, which is limited because of the cost factors,
availability of medical experts, etc. This leads us to seek for indirect tests.
With the growing interest of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, it is
important to propose an algorithm based on blood parameters to improve decision
making. In this paper, we proposed a statistical and machine learning-based
approach to identify the presence of doping substance rhEPO in blood samples.

    <title>A predictive analytics approach for stroke prediction using machine
  learning and neural networks</title>
    <summary>  The negative impact of stroke in society has led to concerted efforts to
improve the management and diagnosis of stroke. With an increased synergy
between technology and medical diagnosis, caregivers create opportunities for
better patient management by systematically mining and archiving the patients'
medical records. Therefore, it is vital to study the interdependency of these
risk factors in patients' health records and understand their relative
contribution to stroke prediction. This paper systematically analyzes the
various factors in electronic health records for effective stroke prediction.
Using various statistical techniques and principal component analysis, we
identify the most important factors for stroke prediction. We conclude that
age, heart disease, average glucose level, and hypertension are the most
important factors for detecting stroke in patients. Furthermore, a perceptron
neural network using these four attributes provides the highest accuracy rate
and lowest miss rate compared to using all available input features and other
benchmarking algorithms. As the dataset is highly imbalanced concerning the
occurrence of stroke, we report our results on a balanced dataset created via
sub-sampling techniques.

    <title>Data Smells in Public Datasets</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, wildlife preservation, autonomous driving and criminal justice
system calls for a data-centric approach to AI. Data scientists spend the
majority of their time studying and wrangling the data, yet tools to aid them
with data analysis are lacking. This study identifies the recurrent data
quality issues in public datasets. Analogous to code smells, we introduce a
novel catalogue of data smells that can be used to indicate early signs of
problems or technical debt in machine learning systems. To understand the
prevalence of data quality issues in datasets, we analyse 25 public datasets
and identify 14 data smells.

    <title>CIGAN: A Python Package for Handling Class Imbalance using Generative
  Adversarial Networks</title>
    <summary>  A key challenge in Machine Learning is class imbalance, where the sample size
of some classes (majority classes) are much higher than that of the other
classes (minority classes). If we were to train a classifier directly on
imbalanced data, it is more likely for the classifier to predict a new sample
as one of the majority classes. In the extreme case, the classifier could
completely ignore the minority classes. This could have serious sociological
implications in healthcare, as the minority classes are usually the disease
classes (e.g., death or positive clinical test result). In this paper, we
introduce a software that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to oversample
the minority classes so as to improve downstream classification. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first tool that allows multi-class classification
(where the target can have an arbitrary number of classes). The code of the
tool is publicly available in our github repository
(https://github.com/yuxiaohuang/research/tree/master/gwu/working/cigan/code).

    <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Retinal Imaging for the detection
  of Systemic Diseases</title>
    <summary>  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of an interpretable and
semiautomatic approach to stage grading ocular pathologies such as Diabetic
retinopathy, Hypertensive retinopathy, and other retinopathies on the backdrop
of major systemic diseases. The experimental study aims to evaluate an
explainable staged grading process without using deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) directly. Many current CNN-based deep neural networks used for
diagnosing retinal disorders might have appreciable performance but fail to
pinpoint the basis driving their decisions. To improve these decisions'
transparency, we have proposed a clinician-in-the-loop assisted intelligent
workflow that performs a retinal vascular assessment on the fundus images to
derive quantifiable and descriptive parameters. The retinal vessel parameters
meta-data serve as hyper-parameters for better interpretation and
explainability of decisions. The semiautomatic methodology aims to have a
federated approach to AI in healthcare applications with more inputs and
interpretations from clinicians. The baseline process involved in the machine
learning pipeline through image processing techniques for optic disc detection,
vessel segmentation, and arteriole/venule identification.

    <title>Investigating Labeler Bias in Face Annotation for Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  In a world increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, it is more
important than ever to consider the ethical implications of artificial
intelligence on humanity. One key under-explored challenge is labeler bias,
which can create inherently biased datasets for training and subsequently lead
to inaccurate or unfair decisions in healthcare, employment, education, and law
enforcement. Hence, we conducted a study to investigate and measure the
existence of labeler bias using images of people from different ethnicities and
sexes in a labeling task. Our results show that participants possess
stereotypes that influence their decision-making process and that labeler
demographics impact assigned labels. We also discuss how labeler bias
influences datasets and, subsequently, the models trained on them. Overall, a
high degree of transparency must be maintained throughout the entire artificial
intelligence training process to identify and correct biases in the data as
early as possible.

    <title>Operationalizing Counterfactual Metrics: Incentives, Ranking, and
  Information Asymmetry</title>
    <summary>  From the social sciences to machine learning, it has been well documented
that metrics to be optimized are not always aligned with social welfare. In
healthcare, Dranove et al. (2003) showed that publishing surgery mortality
metrics actually harmed the welfare of sicker patients by increasing provider
selection behavior. We analyze the incentive misalignments that arise from such
average treated outcome metrics, and show that the incentives driving treatment
decisions would align with maximizing total patient welfare if the metrics (i)
accounted for counterfactual untreated outcomes and (ii) considered total
welfare instead of averaging over treated patients. Operationalizing this, we
show how counterfactual metrics can be modified to behave reasonably in
patient-facing ranking systems. Extending to realistic settings when providers
observe more about patients than the regulatory agencies do, we bound the decay
in performance by the degree of information asymmetry between principal and
agent. In doing so, our model connects principal-agent information asymmetry
with unobserved heterogeneity in causal inference.

    <title>RadGraph2: Modeling Disease Progression in Radiology Reports via
  Hierarchical Information Extraction</title>
    <summary>  We present RadGraph2, a novel dataset for extracting information from
radiology reports that focuses on capturing changes in disease state and device
placement over time. We introduce a hierarchical schema that organizes entities
based on their relationships and show that using this hierarchy during training
improves the performance of an information extraction model. Specifically, we
propose a modification to the DyGIE++ framework, resulting in our model HGIE,
which outperforms previous models in entity and relation extraction tasks. We
demonstrate that RadGraph2 enables models to capture a wider variety of
findings and perform better at relation extraction compared to those trained on
the original RadGraph dataset. Our work provides the foundation for developing
automated systems that can track disease progression over time and develop
information extraction models that leverage the natural hierarchy of labels in
the medical domain.

    <title>Towards User Guided Actionable Recourse</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning's proliferation in critical fields such as healthcare,
banking, and criminal justice has motivated the creation of tools which ensure
trust and transparency in ML models. One such tool is Actionable Recourse (AR)
for negatively impacted users. AR describes recommendations of cost-efficient
changes to a user's actionable features to help them obtain favorable outcomes.
Existing approaches for providing recourse optimize for properties such as
proximity, sparsity, validity, and distance-based costs. However, an
often-overlooked but crucial requirement for actionability is a consideration
of User Preference to guide the recourse generation process. In this work, we
attempt to capture user preferences via soft constraints in three simple forms:
i) scoring continuous features, ii) bounding feature values and iii) ranking
categorical features. Finally, we propose a gradient-based approach to identify
User Preferred Actionable Recourse (UP-AR). We carried out extensive
experiments to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

    <title>Unmasking the Chameleons: A Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Detection
  in Medical Tabular Data</title>
    <summary>  Despite their success, Machine Learning (ML) models do not generalize
effectively to data not originating from the training distribution. To reliably
employ ML models in real-world healthcare systems and avoid inaccurate
predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, it is crucial to detect OOD
samples. Numerous OOD detection approaches have been suggested in other fields
- especially in computer vision - but it remains unclear whether the challenge
is resolved when dealing with medical tabular data. To answer this pressing
need, we propose an extensive reproducible benchmark to compare different
methods across a suite of tests including both near and far OODs. Our benchmark
leverages the latest versions of eICU and MIMIC-IV, two public datasets
encompassing tens of thousands of ICU patients in several hospitals. We
consider a wide array of density-based methods and SOTA post-hoc detectors
across diverse predictive architectures, including MLP, ResNet, and
Transformer. Our findings show that i) the problem appears to be solved for
far-OODs, but remains open for near-OODs; ii) post-hoc methods alone perform
poorly, but improve substantially when coupled with distance-based mechanisms;
iii) the transformer architecture is far less overconfident compared to MLP and
ResNet.

    <title>Multi-domain improves out-of-distribution and data-limited scenarios for
  medical image analysis</title>
    <summary>  Current machine learning methods for medical image analysis primarily focus
on developing models tailored for their specific tasks, utilizing data within
their target domain. These specialized models tend to be data-hungry and often
exhibit limitations in generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. In this
work, we show that employing models that incorporate multiple domains instead
of specialized ones significantly alleviates the limitations observed in
specialized models. We refer to this approach as multi-domain model and compare
its performance to that of specialized models. For this, we introduce the
incorporation of diverse medical image domains, including different imaging
modalities like X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound images, as well as various
viewpoints such as axial, coronal, and sagittal views. Our findings underscore
the superior generalization capabilities of multi-domain models, particularly
in scenarios characterized by limited data availability and
out-of-distribution, frequently encountered in healthcare applications. The
integration of diverse data allows multi-domain models to utilize information
across domains, enhancing the overall outcomes substantially. To illustrate,
for organ recognition, multi-domain model can enhance accuracy by up to 8%
compared to conventional specialized models.

    <title>Game Theory Solutions in Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition: A
  Review</title>
    <summary>  The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks automatically identify human
activities using the sensor data, which has numerous applications in
healthcare, sports, security, and human-computer interaction. Despite
significant advances in HAR, critical challenges still exist. Game theory has
emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges in machine learning
problems including HAR. However, there is a lack of research work on applying
game theory solutions to the HAR problems. This review paper explores the
potential of game theory as a solution for HAR tasks, and bridges the gap
between game theory and HAR research work by suggesting novel game-theoretic
approaches for HAR problems. The contributions of this work include exploring
how game theory can improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR models,

    <title>Using Deep Networks for Scientific Discovery in Physiological Signals</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable success in the
classification of physiological signals. In this study we propose a method for
examining to what extent does a DNN's performance rely on rediscovering
existing features of the signals, as opposed to discovering genuinely new
features. Moreover, we offer a novel method of "removing" a hand-engineered
feature from the network's hypothesis space, thus forcing it to try and learn
representations which are different from known ones, as a method of scientific
exploration. We then build on existing work in the field of interpretability,
specifically class activation maps, to try and infer what new features the
network has learned. We demonstrate this approach using ECG and EEG signals.
With respect to ECG signals we show that for the specific task of classifying
atrial fibrillation, DNNs are likely rediscovering known features. We also show
how our method could be used to discover new features, by selectively removing
some ECG features and "rediscovering" them. We further examine how could our
method be used as a tool for examining scientific hypotheses. We simulate this
scenario by looking into the importance of eye movements in classifying sleep
from EEG. We show that our tool can successfully focus a researcher's attention
by bringing to light patterns in the data that would be hidden otherwise.

    <title>A Multi-Center Study on the Adaptability of a Shared Foundation Model
  for Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing
modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks,
making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR
foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients,
demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training
labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions
remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals
and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study
examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation
model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M
Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The
Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via
continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to
baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local
foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical
prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$
matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while
providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels.
With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially
improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to
match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to
90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch.
Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals
provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility
of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development
of healthcare AI.

    <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Identifying Age-Related Genes
  Using Human Dermal Fibroblast Transcriptome Data</title>
    <summary>  Investigation of age-related genes is of great importance for multiple
purposes, for instance, improving our understanding of the mechanism of ageing,
increasing life expectancy, age prediction, and other healthcare applications.
In his work, starting with a set of 27,142 genes, we develop an
information-theoretic framework for identifying genes that are associated with
aging by applying unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques on human
dermal fibroblast gene expression data. First, we use unsupervised learning and
apply information-theoretic measures to identify key features for effective
representation of gene expression values in the transcriptome data. Using the
identified features, we perform clustering on the data. Finally, we apply
semi-supervised learning on the clusters using different distance measures to
identify novel genes that are potentially associated with aging. Performance
assessment for both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods show the
effectiveness of the framework.

    <title>Personalized Privacy Auditing and Optimization at Test Time</title>
    <summary>  A number of learning models used in consequential domains, such as to assist
in legal, banking, hiring, and healthcare decisions, make use of potentially
sensitive users' information to carry out inference. Further, the complete set
of features is typically required to perform inference. This not only poses
severe privacy risks for the individuals using the learning systems, but also
requires companies and organizations massive human efforts to verify the
correctness of the released information.
  This paper asks whether it is necessary to require \emph{all} input features
for a model to return accurate predictions at test time and shows that, under a
personalized setting, each individual may need to release only a small subset
of these features without impacting the final decisions. The paper also
provides an efficient sequential algorithm that chooses which attributes should
be provided by each individual. Evaluation over several learning tasks shows
that individuals may be able to report as little as 10\% of their information
to ensure the same level of accuracy of a model that uses the complete users'
information.

    <title>Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Internet of Things: Enabling
  Technologies and Future Directions</title>
    <summary>  Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects a massive amount of devices,
generating heterogeneous data with diverse characteristics. IoT data emerges as
a vital asset for data-intensive IoT applications, such as healthcare, smart
city and predictive maintenance, harnessing the vast volume of heterogeneous
data to its maximum advantage. These applications leverage different Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithms to discover new insights. While machine learning
effectively uncovers implicit patterns through model training, centralizing IoT
data for training poses significant privacy and security concerns. Federated
Learning (FL) offers an promising solution, allowing IoT devices to conduct
local learning without sharing raw data with third parties. Model-heterogeneous
FL empowers clients to train models with varying complexities based on their
hardware capabilities, aligning with heterogeneity of devices in real-world IoT
environments. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art
model-heterogeneous FL methods and provide insights into their merits and
limitations. Moreover, we showcase their applicability to IoT and identify the
open problems and future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first article that focuses on the topic of model-heterogeneous FL for IoT.

    <title>Identifiable Phenotyping using Constrained Non-Negative Matrix
  Factorization</title>
    <summary>  This work proposes a new algorithm for automated and simultaneous phenotyping
of multiple co-occurring medical conditions, also referred as comorbidities,
using clinical notes from the electronic health records (EHRs). A basic latent
factor estimation technique of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is
augmented with domain specific constraints to obtain sparse latent factors that
are anchored to a fixed set of chronic conditions. The proposed anchoring
mechanism ensures a one-to-one identifiable and interpretable mapping between
the latent factors and the target comorbidities. Qualitative assessment of the
empirical results by clinical experts suggests that the proposed model learns
clinically interpretable phenotypes while being predictive of 30 day mortality.
The proposed method can be readily adapted to any non-negative EHR data across
various healthcare institutions.

    <title>Adaptive Feature Processing for Robust Human Activity Recognition on a
  Novel Multi-Modal Dataset</title>
    <summary>  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a key building block of many emerging
applications such as intelligent mobility, sports analytics, ambient-assisted
living and human-robot interaction. With robust HAR, systems will become more
human-aware, leading towards much safer and empathetic autonomous systems.
While human pose detection has made significant progress with the dawn of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the state-of-the-art research has almost
exclusively focused on a single sensing modality, especially video. However, in
safety critical applications it is imperative to utilize multiple sensor
modalities for robust operation. To exploit the benefits of state-of-the-art
machine learning techniques for HAR, it is extremely important to have
multimodal datasets. In this paper, we present a novel, multi-modal sensor
dataset that encompasses nine indoor activities, performed by 16 participants,
and captured by four types of sensors that are commonly used in indoor
applications and autonomous vehicles. This multimodal dataset is the first of
its kind to be made openly available and can be exploited for many applications
that require HAR, including sports analytics, healthcare assistance and indoor
intelligent mobility. We propose a novel data preprocessing algorithm to enable
adaptive feature extraction from the dataset to be utilized by different
machine learning algorithms. Through rigorous experimental evaluations, this
paper reviews the performance of machine learning approaches to posture
recognition, and analyses the robustness of the algorithms. When performing HAR
with the RGB-Depth data from our new dataset, machine learning algorithms such
as a deep neural network reached a mean accuracy of up to 96.8% for
classification across all stationary and dynamic activities

    <title>A Workflow for Visual Diagnostics of Binary Classifiers using
  Instance-Level Explanations</title>
    <summary>  Human-in-the-loop data analysis applications necessitate greater transparency
in machine learning models for experts to understand and trust their decisions.
To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and
domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary
classifier. The approach leverages "instance-level explanations", measures of
local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a
set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The
workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on
aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect
decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to
make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on
potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a
long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare
professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they
developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the
proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the
phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a
model can be improved.

    <title>A Meta-learning based Generalizable Indoor Localization Model using
  Channel State Information</title>
    <summary>  Indoor localization has gained significant attention in recent years due to
its various applications in smart homes, industrial automation, and healthcare,
especially since more people rely on their wireless devices for location-based
services. Deep learning-based solutions have shown promising results in
accurately estimating the position of wireless devices in indoor environments
using wireless parameters such as Channel State Information (CSI) and Received
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). However, despite the success of deep
learning-based approaches in achieving high localization accuracy, these models
suffer from a lack of generalizability and can not be readily-deployed to new
environments or operate in dynamic environments without retraining. In this
paper, we propose meta-learning-based localization models to address the lack
of generalizability that persists in conventionally trained DL-based
localization models. Furthermore, since meta-learning algorithms require
diverse datasets from several different scenarios, which can be hard to collect
in the context of localization, we design and propose a new meta-learning
algorithm, TB-MAML (Task Biased Model Agnostic Meta Learning), intended to
further improve generalizability when the dataset is limited. Lastly, we
evaluate the performance of TB-MAML-based localization against conventionally
trained localization models and localization done using other meta-learning
algorithms.

    <title>Privacy at a Price: Exploring its Dual Impact on AI Fairness</title>
    <summary>  The worldwide adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models,
particularly in critical sectors, such as healthcare and finance, presents
substantial challenges in maintaining individual privacy and fairness. These
two elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While
numerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through
differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that
differential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate
demographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness
concern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is
that enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet
significant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article,
with extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of
differential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that
the accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is
added to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels
with even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the
differentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the
negative impact of DP noise on fairness. This mitigation is achieved by
moderating the disparity growth through a lower clipping threshold.

    <title>Transfer Learning for Clinical Time Series Analysis using Recurrent
  Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Deep neural networks have shown promising results for various clinical
prediction tasks such as diagnosis, mortality prediction, predicting duration
of stay in hospital, etc. However, training deep networks -- such as those
based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) -- requires large labeled data, high
computational resources, and significant hyperparameter tuning effort. In this
work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address these
issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series. We
consider transferring the knowledge captured in an RNN trained on several
source tasks simultaneously using a large labeled dataset to build the model
for a target task with limited labeled data. An RNN pre-trained on several
tasks provides generic features, which are then used to build simpler linear
models for new target tasks without training task-specific RNNs. For
evaluation, we train a deep RNN to identify several patient phenotypes on time
series from MIMIC-III database, and then use the features extracted using that
RNN to build classifiers for identifying previously unseen phenotypes, and also
for a seemingly unrelated task of in-hospital mortality. We demonstrate that
(i) models trained on features extracted using pre-trained RNN outperform or,
in the worst case, perform as well as task-specific RNNs; (ii) the models using
features from pre-trained models are more robust to the size of labeled data
than task-specific RNNs; and (iii) features extracted using pre-trained RNN are
generic enough and perform better than typical statistical hand-crafted
features.

    <title>Survey of Machine Learning Based Intrusion Detection Methods for
  Internet of Medical Things</title>
    <summary>  The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized the healthcare
industry by enabling physiological data collection using sensors, which are
transmitted to remote servers for continuous analysis by physicians and
healthcare professionals. This technology offers numerous benefits, including
early disease detection and automatic medication for patients with chronic
illnesses. However, IoMT technology also presents significant security risks,
such as violating patient privacy or exposing sensitive data to interception
attacks due to wireless communication, which could be fatal for the patient.
Additionally, traditional security measures, such as cryptography, are
challenging to implement in medical equipment due to the heterogeneous
communication and their limited computation, storage, and energy capacity.
These protection methods are also ineffective against new and zero-day attacks.
It is essential to adopt robust security measures to ensure data integrity,
confidentiality, and availability during data collection, transmission,
storage, and processing. In this context, using Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS) based on Machine Learning (ML) can bring a complementary security
solution adapted to the unique characteristics of IoMT systems. Therefore, this
paper investigates how IDS based on ML can address security and privacy issues
in IoMT systems. First, the generic three-layer architecture of IoMT is
provided, and the security requirements of IoMT systems are outlined. Then, the
various threats that can affect IoMT security are identified, and the
advantages, disadvantages, methods, and datasets used in each solution based on
ML at the three layers that make up IoMT are presented. Finally, the paper
discusses the challenges and limitations of applying IDS based on ML at each
layer of IoMT, which can serve as a future research direction.

    <title>A Foundational Framework and Methodology for Personalized Early and
  Timely Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  Early diagnosis of diseases holds the potential for deep transformation in
healthcare by enabling better treatment options, improving long-term survival
and quality of life, and reducing overall cost. With the advent of medical big
data, advances in diagnostic tests as well as in machine learning and
statistics, early or timely diagnosis seems within reach. Early diagnosis
research often neglects the potential for optimizing individual diagnostic
paths. To enable personalized early diagnosis, a foundational framework is
needed that delineates the diagnosis process and systematically identifies the
time-dependent value of various diagnostic tests for an individual patient
given their unique characteristics. Here, we propose the first foundational
framework for early and timely diagnosis. It builds on decision-theoretic
approaches to outline the diagnosis process and integrates machine learning and
statistical methodology for estimating the optimal personalized diagnostic
path. To describe the proposed framework as well as possibly other frameworks,
we provide essential definitions.
  The development of a foundational framework is necessary for several reasons:
1) formalism provides clarity for the development of decision support tools; 2)
observed information can be complemented with estimates of the future patient
trajectory; 3) the net benefit of counterfactual diagnostic paths and
associated uncertainties can be modeled for individuals 4) 'early' and 'timely'
diagnosis can be clearly defined; 5) a mechanism emerges for assessing the
value of technologies in terms of their impact on personalized early diagnosis,
resulting health outcomes and incurred costs.
  Finally, we hope that this foundational framework will unlock the
long-awaited potential of timely diagnosis and intervention, leading to
improved outcomes for patients and higher cost-effectiveness for healthcare
systems.

    <title>Decentralised, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
  for Multi-Hospital Data</title>
    <summary>  Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated its great potential on medical data
analysis. Large datasets collected from diverse sources and settings are
essential for ML models in healthcare to achieve better accuracy and
generalizability. Sharing data across different healthcare institutions is
challenging because of complex and varying privacy and regulatory requirements.
Hence, it is hard but crucial to allow multiple parties to collaboratively
train an ML model leveraging the private datasets available at each party
without the need for direct sharing of those datasets or compromising the
privacy of the datasets through collaboration. In this paper, we address this
challenge by proposing Decentralized, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving ML
for Multi-Hospital Data (DeCaPH). It offers the following key benefits: (1) it
allows different parties to collaboratively train an ML model without
transferring their private datasets; (2) it safeguards patient privacy by
limiting the potential privacy leakage arising from any contents shared across
the parties during the training process; and (3) it facilitates the ML model
training without relying on a centralized server. We demonstrate the
generalizability and power of DeCaPH on three distinct tasks using real-world
distributed medical datasets: patient mortality prediction using electronic
health records, cell-type classification using single-cell human genomes, and
pathology identification using chest radiology images. We demonstrate that the
ML models trained with DeCaPH framework have an improved utility-privacy
trade-off, showing it enables the models to have good performance while
preserving the privacy of the training data points. In addition, the ML models
trained with DeCaPH framework in general outperform those trained solely with
the private datasets from individual parties, showing that DeCaPH enhances the
model generalizability.

    <title>VR-NRP: A Virtual Reality Simulation for Training in the Neonatal
  Resuscitation Program</title>
    <summary>  The use of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies has been extensively researched
in surgical and anatomical education. VR provides a lifelike and interactive
environment where healthcare providers can practice and refresh their skills in
a safe environment. VR has been shown to be as effective as traditional medical
education teaching methods, with the potential to provide more cost-effective
and convenient means of curriculum delivery, especially in rural and remote
areas or in environments with limited access to hands-on training. In this
sense, VR offers the potential to be used to support resuscitation training for
healthcare providers such as the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). The NRP
program is an evidence-based and standardized approach for training healthcare
providers on the resuscitation of the newborn. In this article, we describe a
VR simulation environment that was designed and developed to refresh the skills
of NRP providers. To validate this platform, we compared the VR-NRP simulation
with exposure to 360-degree immersive video. We found that both VR technologies
were positively viewed by healthcare professionals and performed very similarly
to each other. However, the VR simulation provided a significantly increased
feeling of presence. Furthermore, participants found the VR simulation more
useful, leading to improved experiential learning outcomes. Also, participants
using VR simulation reported higher confidence in certain NRP skills, such as
proper mask placement and newborn response evaluation. This research represents
a step forward in understanding how VR and related extended reality (XR)
technologies can be applied for effective, immersive medical education, with
potential benefits for remote and rural healthcare providers.

    <title>Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation Model</title>
    <summary>  The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare
systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a
patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models
currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while
only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant
challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital
for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To
tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and
input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research
aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model
Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate
prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However,
the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an
out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a
novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based
models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational
costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To
mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation
technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model.
Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective
results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments,
we release the implementation code online.

    <title>iGLU 1.0: An Accurate Non-Invasive Near-Infrared Dual Short Wavelengths
  Spectroscopy based Glucometer for Smart Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  In the case of diabetes, fingertip pricking for a blood sample is
inconvenient for glucose measurement. Invasive approaches like laboratory test
and one-touch glucometer enhance the risk of blood-related infections. To
mitigate this important issue, in the current paper, we propose a novel
Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) enabled edge-device for precise, non-invasive
blood glucose measurement. In this work, a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic
technique using two wavelengths (940 nm, 1300 nm) is taken to detect the
glucose molecule from human blood. The novel device called iGLU is based on NIR
spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) models of high accuracy. An optimal
multiple polynomial regression model and deep neural network (DNN) model have
been presented for precise measurement. The proposed device is validated and
blood glucose values are stored on the cloud using open IoT platform for remote
monitoring by an endocrinologist. For device validation, the estimated blood
glucose values have been compared with blood glucose values obtained from the
invasive device. It has been observed that mean absolute relative difference
(MARD) and average error (AvgE) are found 4.66 % and 4.61 % respectively from
predicted blood glucose concentration values. The regression coefficient is
found 0.81. The proposed spectroscopic non-invasive device provides accurate
and cost-effective solution for smart healthcare.

    <title>Multi-institution encrypted medical imaging AI validation without data
  sharing</title>
    <summary>  Adoption of artificial intelligence medical imaging applications is often
impeded by barriers between healthcare systems and algorithm developers given
that access to both private patient data and commercial model IP is important
to perform pre-deployment evaluation. This work investigates a framework for
secure, privacy-preserving and AI-enabled medical imaging inference using
CrypTFlow2, a state-of-the-art end-to-end compiler allowing cryptographically
secure 2-party Computation (2PC) protocols between the machine learning model
vendor and target patient data owner. A common DenseNet-121 chest x-ray
diagnosis model was evaluated on multi-institutional chest radiographic imaging
datasets both with and without CrypTFlow2 on two test sets spanning seven sites
across the US and India, and comprising 1,149 chest x-ray images. We measure
comparative AUROC performance between secure and insecure inference in multiple
pathology classification tasks, and explore model output distributional shifts
and resource constraints introduced by secure model inference. Secure inference
with CrypTFlow2 demonstrated no significant difference in AUROC for all
diagnoses, and model outputs from secure and insecure inference methods were
distributionally equivalent. The use of CrypTFlow2 may allow off-the-shelf
secure 2PC between healthcare systems and AI model vendors for medical imaging,
without changes in performance, and can facilitate scalable pre-deployment
infrastructure for real-world secure model evaluation without exposure to
patient data or model IP.

    <title>A Two-Stage Feature Selection Approach for Robust Evaluation of
  Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Observational Data</title>
    <summary>  A Randomized Control Trial (RCT) is considered as the gold standard for
evaluating the effect of any intervention or treatment. However, its
feasibility is often hindered by ethical, economical, and legal considerations,
making observational data a valuable alternative for drawing causal
conclusions. Nevertheless, healthcare observational data presents a difficult
challenge due to its high dimensionality, requiring careful consideration to
ensure unbiased, reliable, and robust causal inferences. To overcome this
challenge, in this study, we propose a novel two-stage feature selection
technique called, Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net (OAENet), explicitly designed
for making robust causal inference decisions using matching techniques. OAENet
offers several key advantages over existing methods: superior performance on
correlated and high-dimensional data compared to the existing methods and the
ability to select specific sets of variables (including confounders and
variables associated only with the outcome). This ensures robustness and
facilitates an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Numerical experiments on
simulated data demonstrate that OAENet significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by either producing a higher-quality estimate or a
comparable estimate in significantly less time. To illustrate the applicability
of OAENet, we employ large-scale US healthcare data to estimate the effect of
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) on suicidal behavior. When compared to competing
methods, OAENet closely aligns with existing literature on the relationship
between OUD and suicidal behavior. Performance on both simulated and real-world
data highlights that OAENet notably enhances the accuracy of estimating
treatment effects or evaluating policy decision-making with causal inference.

    <title>Basic principles and concept design of a real-time clinical decision
  support system for managing medical emergencies on missions to Mars</title>
    <summary>  Space agencies and private companies prepare the beginning of human space
exploration for the 2030s with missions to put the first human on the Mars
surface. The absence of gravity and radiation, along with distance, isolation
and hostile environments, are expected to increase medical events where
previously unseen manifestations may arise. The current healthcare strategy
based on telemedicine and the possibility to stabilize and transport the
injured crewmember to a terrestrial definitive medical facility is not
applicable in exploration class missions. Therefore, the need for deploying the
full autonomous capability to solve medical emergencies may guide the design of
future onboard healthcare systems. We present ten basic principles and concept
design of a software suite to bring onboard decision support to help the crew
dealing with medical emergencies taking into consideration physiological
disturbances in space and spaceflight restrictions. 1) give real-time support
for emergency medical decision making, 2) give patient-specific advice for
executive problem-solving, 3) take into account available information from life
support and monitoring of crewmembers, 4) be fully autonomous from remote
facilities, 5) continuously adapt predictions to physiological disturbance and
changing conditions, 6) optimize emergency medical decision making in terms of
mission fundamental priorities, 7) take into account medical supplies and
equipment on board, 8) apply health standards for the level of care V, 9)
implement ethics responsibilities for spaceflights, and 10) apply ethical
standards for artificial intelligence. Based on these principles, we propose an
autonomous clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time advice
for emergency medical interventions on board of space exploration missions.

    <title>A health telemonitoring platform based on data integration from
  different sources</title>
    <summary>  The management of people with long-term or chronic illness is one of the
biggest challenges for national health systems. In fact, these diseases are
among the leading causes of hospitalization, especially for the elderly, and
huge amount of resources required to monitor them leads to problems with
sustainability of the healthcare systems. The increasing diffusion of portable
devices and new connectivity technologies allows the implementation of
telemonitoring system capable of providing support to health care providers and
lighten the burden on hospitals and clinics. In this paper, we present the
implementation of a telemonitoring platform for healthcare, designed to capture
several types of physiological health parameters from different consumer mobile
and custom devices. Consumer medical devices can be integrated into the
platform via the Google Fit ecosystem that supports hundreds of devices, while
custom devices can directly interact with the platform with standard
communication protocols. The platform is designed to process the acquired data
using machine learning algorithms, and to provide patients and physicians the
physiological health parameters with a user-friendly, comprehensive, and easy
to understand dashboard which monitors the parameters through time. Preliminary
usability tests show a good user satisfaction in terms of functionality and
usefulness.

    <title>SPeC: A Soft Prompt-Based Calibration on Performance Variability of
  Large Language Model in Clinical Notes Summarization</title>
    <summary>  Electronic health records (EHRs) store an extensive array of patient
information, encompassing medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and test
outcomes. These records are crucial for enabling healthcare providers to make
well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes
further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks
and making better-informed decisions. This process contributes to reducing
errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the
most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that
incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts
the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also
leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even
when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft
prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based
summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs
indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively
curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable
solution for summarizing vital medical information.

    <title>Finding Statistically Significant Interactions between Continuous
  Features</title>
    <summary>  The search for higher-order feature interactions that are statistically
significantly associated with a class variable is of high relevance in fields
such as Genetics or Healthcare, but the combinatorial explosion of the
candidate space makes this problem extremely challenging in terms of
computational efficiency and proper correction for multiple testing. While
recent progress has been made regarding this challenge for binary features, we
here present the first solution for continuous features. We propose an
algorithm which overcomes the combinatorial explosion of the search space of
higher-order interactions by deriving a lower bound on the p-value for each
interaction, which enables us to massively prune interactions that can never
reach significance and to thereby gain more statistical power. In our
experiments, our approach efficiently detects all significant interactions in a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

    <title>Modeling Mistrust in End-of-Life Care</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we characterize the doctor-patient relationship using a machine
learning-derived trust score. We show that this score has statistically
significant racial associations, and that by modeling trust directly we find
stronger disparities in care than by stratifying on race. We further
demonstrate that mistrust is indicative of worse outcomes, but is only weakly
associated with physiologically-created severity scores. Finally, we describe
sentiment analysis experiments indicating patients with higher levels of
mistrust have worse experiences and interactions with their caregivers. This
work is a step towards measuring fairer machine learning in the healthcare
domain.

    <title>Regional Tree Regularization for Interpretability in Black Box Models</title>
    <summary>  The lack of interpretability remains a barrier to the adoption of deep neural
networks. Recently, tree regularization has been proposed to encourage deep
neural networks to resemble compact, axis-aligned decision trees without
significant compromises in accuracy. However, it may be unreasonable to expect
that a single tree can predict well across all possible inputs. In this work,
we propose regional tree regularization, which encourages a deep model to be
well-approximated by several separate decision trees specific to predefined
regions of the input space. Practitioners can define regions based on domain
knowledge of contexts where different decision-making logic is needed. Across
many datasets, our approach delivers more accurate predictions than simply
training separate decision trees for each region, while producing simpler
explanations than other neural net regularization schemes without sacrificing
predictive power. Two healthcare case studies in critical care and HIV
demonstrate how experts can improve understanding of deep models via our
approach.

    <title>Fast Imbalanced Classification of Healthcare Data with Missing Values</title>
    <summary>  In medical domain, data features often contain missing values. This can
create serious bias in the predictive modeling. Typical standard data mining
methods often produce poor performance measures. In this paper, we propose a
new method to simultaneously classify large datasets and reduce the effects of
missing values. The proposed method is based on a multilevel framework of the
cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation method for missing
values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We compare classification
results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public benchmark datasets with
imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real data in health
applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method produces fast, and
more accurate and robust classification results.

    <title>Novel quantitative indicators of digital ophthalmoscopy image quality</title>
    <summary>  With the advent of smartphone indirect ophthalmoscopy, teleophthalmology -
the use of specialist ophthalmology assets at a distance from the patient - has
experienced a breakthrough, promising enormous benefits especially for
healthcare in distant, inaccessible or opthalmologically underserved areas,
where specialists are either unavailable or too few in number. However,
accurate teleophthalmology requires high-quality ophthalmoscopic imagery. This
paper considers three feature families - statistical metrics, gradient-based
metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators - as possible
metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine
learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality
assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased
availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the
increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating
tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically
suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the
teleophthalmology process. This paper highlights the need for more research in
this area, including the compilation of a diverse database of ophthalmoscopic
imagery, annotated with quality markers, to train the Point of Acquisition
error detection algorithms of the future.

    <title>Why have a Unified Predictive Uncertainty? Disentangling it using Deep
  Split Ensembles</title>
    <summary>  Understanding and quantifying uncertainty in black box Neural Networks (NNs)
is critical when deployed in real-world settings such as healthcare. Recent
works using Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods have shown how a unified
predictive uncertainty can be modelled for NNs. Decomposing this uncertainty to
disentangle the granular sources of heteroscedasticity in data provides rich
information about its underlying causes. We propose a conceptually simple
non-Bayesian approach, deep split ensemble, to disentangle the predictive
uncertainties using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. The NNs are trained
with clusters of input features, for uncertainty estimates per cluster. We
evaluate our approach on a series of benchmark regression datasets, while also
comparing with unified uncertainty methods. Extensive analyses using dataset
shits and empirical rule highlight our inherently well-calibrated models. Our
work further demonstrates its applicability in a multi-modal setting using a
benchmark Alzheimer's dataset and also shows how deep split ensembles can
highlight hidden modality-specific biases. The minimal changes required to NNs
and the training procedure, and the high flexibility to group features into
clusters makes it readily deployable and useful. The source code is available

    <title>A Sparsity Algorithm with Applications to Corporate Credit Rating</title>
    <summary>  In Artificial Intelligence, interpreting the results of a Machine Learning
technique often termed as a black box is a difficult task. A counterfactual
explanation of a particular "black box" attempts to find the smallest change to
the input values that modifies the prediction to a particular output, other
than the original one. In this work we formulate the problem of finding a
counterfactual explanation as an optimization problem. We propose a new
"sparsity algorithm" which solves the optimization problem, while also
maximizing the sparsity of the counterfactual explanation. We apply the
sparsity algorithm to provide a simple suggestion to publicly traded companies
in order to improve their credit ratings. We validate the sparsity algorithm
with a synthetically generated dataset and we further apply it to quarterly
financial statements from companies in financial, healthcare and IT sectors of
the US market. We provide evidence that the counterfactual explanation can
capture the nature of the real statement features that changed between the
current quarter and the following quarter when ratings improved. The empirical
results show that the higher the rating of a company the greater the "effort"
required to further improve credit rating.

    <title>Aggregate-Eliminate-Predict: Detecting Adverse Drug Events from
  Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of detecting adverse drug events in electronic
healthcare records. The challenge in this work is to aggregate heterogeneous
data types involving diagnosis codes, drug codes, as well as lab measurements.
An earlier framework proposed for the same problem demonstrated promising
predictive performance for the random forest classifier by using only lab
measurements as data features. We extend this framework, by additionally
including diagnosis and drug prescription codes, concurrently. In addition, we
employ a recursive feature selection mechanism on top, that extracts the top-k
most important features. Our experimental evaluation on five medical datasets
of adverse drug events and six different classifiers, suggests that the
integration of these additional features provides substantial and statistically
significant improvements in terms of AUC, while employing medically relevant
features.

    <title>MM for Penalized Estimation</title>
    <summary>  Penalized estimation can conduct variable selection and parameter estimation
simultaneously. The general framework is to minimize a loss function subject to
a penalty designed to generate sparse variable selection. The
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is a computational scheme for
stability and simplicity, and the MM algorithm has been widely applied in
penalized estimation. Much of the previous work have focused on convex loss
functions such as generalized linear models. When data are contaminated with
outliers, robust loss functions can generate more reliable estimates. Recent
literature has witnessed a growing impact of nonconvex loss-based methods,
which can generate robust estimation for data contaminated with outliers. This
article investigates MM algorithm for penalized estimation, provide innovative
optimality conditions and establish convergence theory with both convex and
nonconvex loss functions. With respect to applications, we focus on several
nonconvex loss functions, which were formerly studied in machine learning for
regression and classification problems. Performance of the proposed algorithms
are evaluated on simulated and real data including healthcare costs and cancer
clinical status. Efficient implementations of the algorithms are available in
the R package mpath in CRAN.

    <title>Algorithmic Fairness</title>
    <summary>  An increasing number of decisions regarding the daily lives of human beings
are being controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in spheres
ranging from healthcare, transportation, and education to college admissions,
recruitment, provision of loans and many more realms. Since they now touch on
many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to develop AI algorithms that are not
only accurate but also objective and fair. Recent studies have shown that
algorithmic decision-making may be inherently prone to unfairness, even when
there is no intention for it. This paper presents an overview of the main
concepts of identifying, measuring and improving algorithmic fairness when
using AI algorithms. The paper begins by discussing the causes of algorithmic
bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness.
Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process,
in-process and post-process mechanisms. A comprehensive comparison of the
mechanisms is then conducted, towards a better understanding of which
mechanisms should be used in different scenarios. The paper then describes the
most commonly used fairness-related datasets in this field. Finally, the paper
ends by reviewing several emerging research sub-fields of algorithmic fairness.

    <title>EmbPred30: Assessing 30-days Readmission for Diabetic Patients using
  Categorical Embeddings</title>
    <summary>  Hospital readmission is a crucial healthcare quality measure that helps in
determining the level of quality of care that a hospital offers to a patient
and has proven to be immensely expensive. It is estimated that more than $25
billion are spent yearly due to readmission of diabetic patients in the USA.
This paper benchmarks existing models and proposes a new embedding based
state-of-the-art deep neural network(DNN). The model can identify whether a
hospitalized diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days or not with an
accuracy of 95.2% and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics(AUROC)
of 97.4% on data collected from 130 US hospitals between 1999-2008. The results
are encouraging with patients having changes in medication while admitted
having a high chance of getting readmitted. Identifying prospective patients
for readmission could help the hospital systems in improving their inpatient
care, thereby saving them from unnecessary expenditures.

    <title>Analogies and Feature Attributions for Model Agnostic Explanation of
  Similarity Learners</title>
    <summary>  Post-hoc explanations for black box models have been studied extensively in
classification and regression settings. However, explanations for models that
output similarity between two inputs have received comparatively lesser
attention. In this paper, we provide model agnostic local explanations for
similarity learners applicable to tabular and text data. We first propose a
method that provides feature attributions to explain the similarity between a
pair of inputs as determined by a black box similarity learner. We then propose
analogies as a new form of explanation in machine learning. Here the goal is to
identify diverse analogous pairs of examples that share the same level of
similarity as the input pair and provide insight into (latent) factors
underlying the model's prediction. The selection of analogies can optionally
leverage feature attributions, thus connecting the two forms of explanation
while still maintaining complementarity. We prove that our analogy objective
function is submodular, making the search for good-quality analogies efficient.
We apply the proposed approaches to explain similarities between sentences as
predicted by a state-of-the-art sentence encoder, and between patients in a
healthcare utilization application. Efficacy is measured through quantitative
evaluations, a careful user study, and examples of explanations.

    <title>Off-Policy Confidence Interval Estimation with Confounded Markov
  Decision Process</title>
    <summary>  This paper is concerned with constructing a confidence interval for a target
policy's value offline based on a pre-collected observational data in infinite
horizon settings. Most of the existing works assume no unmeasured variables
exist that confound the observed actions. This assumption, however, is likely
to be violated in real applications such as healthcare and technological
industries. In this paper, we show that with some auxiliary variables that
mediate the effect of actions on the system dynamics, the target policy's value
is identifiable in a confounded Markov decision process. Based on this result,
we develop an efficient off-policy value estimator that is robust to potential
model misspecification and provide rigorous uncertainty quantification. Our
method is justified by theoretical results, simulated and real datasets
obtained from ridesharing companies. A Python implementation of the proposed
procedure is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/cope.

    <title>A Multifaceted Benchmarking of Synthetic Electronic Health Record
  Generation Models</title>
    <summary>  Synthetic health data have the potential to mitigate privacy concerns when
sharing data to support biomedical research and the development of innovative
healthcare applications. Modern approaches for data generation based on machine
learning, generative adversarial networks (GAN) methods in particular, continue
to evolve and demonstrate remarkable potential. Yet there is a lack of a
systematic assessment framework to benchmark methods as they emerge and
determine which methods are most appropriate for which use cases. In this work,
we introduce a generalizable benchmarking framework to appraise key
characteristics of synthetic health data with respect to utility and privacy
metrics. We apply the framework to evaluate synthetic data generation methods
for electronic health records (EHRs) data from two large academic medical
centers with respect to several use cases. The results illustrate that there is
a utility-privacy tradeoff for sharing synthetic EHR data. The results further
indicate that no method is unequivocally the best on all criteria in each use
case, which makes it evident why synthetic data generation methods need to be
assessed in context.

    <title>MedDiff: Generating Electronic Health Records using Accelerated
  Denoising Diffusion Model</title>
    <summary>  Due to patient privacy protection concerns, machine learning research in
healthcare has been undeniably slower and limited than in other application
domains. High-quality, realistic, synthetic electronic health records (EHRs)
can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments for research
purposes while mitigating privacy concerns associated with data sharing. The
current state-of-the-art model for synthetic EHR generation is generative
adversarial networks, which are notoriously difficult to train and can suffer
from mode collapse. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, a class of
generative models inspired by statistical thermodynamics, have recently been
shown to generate high-quality synthetic samples in certain domains. It is
unknown whether these can generalize to generation of large-scale,
high-dimensional EHRs. In this paper, we present a novel generative model based
on diffusion models that is the first successful application on electronic
health records. Our model proposes a mechanism to perform class-conditional
sampling to preserve label information. We also introduce a new sampling
strategy to accelerate the inference speed. We empirically show that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art synthetic EHR generation methods.

    <title>Extracting Digital Biomarkers for Unobtrusive Stress State Screening
  from Multimodal Wearable Data</title>
    <summary>  With the development of wearable technologies, a new kind of healthcare data
has become valuable as medical information. These data provide meaningful
information regarding an individual's physiological and psychological states,
such as activity level, mood, stress, and cognitive health. These biomarkers
are named digital since they are collected from digital devices integrated with
various sensors. In this study, we explore digital biomarkers related to stress
modality by examining data collected from mobile phones and smartwatches. We
utilize machine learning techniques on the Tesserae dataset, precisely Random
Forest, to extract stress biomarkers. Using feature selection techniques, we
utilize weather, activity, heart rate (HR), stress, sleep, and location
(work-home) measurements from wearables to determine the most important
stress-related biomarkers. We believe we contribute to interpreting stress
biomarkers with a high range of features from different devices. In addition,
we classify the $5$ different stress levels with the most important features,
and our results show that we can achieve $85\%$ overall class accuracy by
adjusting class imbalance and adding extra features related to personality
characteristics. We perform similar and even better results in recognizing
stress states with digital biomarkers in a daily-life scenario targeting a
higher number of classes compared to the related studies.

    <title>Adaptive Conformal Regression with Jackknife+ Rescaled Scores</title>
    <summary>  Conformal regression provides prediction intervals with global coverage
guarantees, but often fails to capture local error distributions, leading to
non-homogeneous coverage. We address this with a new adaptive method based on
rescaling conformal scores with an estimate of local score distribution,
inspired by the Jackknife+ method, which enables the use of calibration data in
conformal scores without breaking calibration-test exchangeability. Our
approach ensures formal global coverage guarantees and is supported by new
theoretical results on local coverage, including an a posteriori bound on any
calibration score. The strength of our approach lies in achieving local
coverage without sacrificing calibration set size, improving the applicability
of conformal prediction intervals in various settings. As a result, our method
provides prediction intervals that outperform previous methods, particularly in
the low-data regime, making it especially relevant for real-world applications
such as healthcare and biomedical domains where uncertainty needs to be
quantified accurately despite low sample data.

    <title>Signature Activation: A Sparse Signal View for Holistic Saliency</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of machine learning in healthcare calls for model transparency
and explainability. In this work, we introduce Signature Activation, a saliency
method that generates holistic and class-agnostic explanations for
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outputs. Our method exploits the fact that
certain kinds of medical images, such as angiograms, have clear foreground and
background objects. We give theoretical explanation to justify our methods. We
show the potential use of our method in clinical settings through evaluating
its efficacy for aiding the detection of lesions in coronary angiograms.

    <title>Data Acquisition via Experimental Design for Decentralized Data Markets</title>
    <summary>  Acquiring high-quality training data is essential for current machine
learning models. Data markets provide a way to increase the supply of data,
particularly in data-scarce domains such as healthcare, by incentivizing
potential data sellers to join the market. A major challenge for a data buyer
in such a market is selecting the most valuable data points from a data seller.
Unlike prior work in data valuation, which assumes centralized data access, we
propose a federated approach to the data selection problem that is inspired by
linear experimental design. Our proposed data selection method achieves lower
prediction error without requiring labeled validation data and can be optimized
in a fast and federated procedure. The key insight of our work is that a method
that directly estimates the benefit of acquiring data for test set prediction
is particularly compatible with a decentralized market setting.

    <title>A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time
  Series</title>
    <summary>  Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for
numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems.
However, even high-performed models may exhibit potential issues such as
biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model
explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable
insights to detect such issues by elucidating model attributions of their
decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and
not scalable across dataset, and they provide one-directional information from
the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected
issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed
to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for
enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual
interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct
unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation with two time series
datasets and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD in fostering
a deeper human understanding, immediate corrective actions, and the reliability
enhancement of models.

    <title>Forecasting Internally Displaced Population Migration Patterns in Syria
  and Yemen</title>
    <summary>  Armed conflict has led to an unprecedented number of internally displaced
persons (IDPs) - individuals who are forced out of their homes but remain
within their country. IDPs often urgently require shelter, food, and
healthcare, yet prediction of when large fluxes of IDPs will cross into an area
remains a major challenge for aid delivery organizations. Accurate forecasting
of IDP migration would empower humanitarian aid groups to more effectively
allocate resources during conflicts. We show that monthly flow of IDPs from
province to province in both Syria and Yemen can be accurately forecasted one
month in advance, using publicly available data. We model monthly IDP flow
using data on food price, fuel price, wage, geospatial, and news data. We find
that machine learning approaches can more accurately forecast migration trends
than baseline persistence models. Our findings thus potentially enable
proactive aid allocation for IDPs in anticipation of forecasted arrivals.

    <title>GRU-ODE-Bayes: Continuous modeling of sporadically-observed time series</title>
    <summary>  Modeling real-world multidimensional time series can be particularly
challenging when these are sporadically observed (i.e., sampling is irregular
both in time and across dimensions)-such as in the case of clinical patient
data. To address these challenges, we propose (1) a continuous-time version of
the Gated Recurrent Unit, building upon the recent Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Chen et al., 2018), and (2) a Bayesian update network that processes
the sporadic observations. We bring these two ideas together in our
GRU-ODE-Bayes method. We then demonstrate that the proposed method encodes a
continuity prior for the latent process and that it can exactly represent the
Fokker-Planck dynamics of complex processes driven by a multidimensional
stochastic differential equation. Additionally, empirical evaluation shows that
our method outperforms the state of the art on both synthetic data and
real-world data with applications in healthcare and climate forecast. What is
more, the continuity prior is shown to be well suited for low number of samples
settings.

    <title>Continuous Monitoring of Blood Pressure with Evidential Regression</title>
    <summary>  Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal-based blood pressure (BP) estimation is a
promising candidate for modern BP measurements, as PPG signals can be easily
obtained from wearable devices in a non-invasive manner, allowing quick BP
measurement. However, the performance of existing machine learning-based BP
measuring methods still fall behind some BP measurement guidelines and most of
them provide only point estimates of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In this paper, we present a cutting-edge method
which is capable of continuously monitoring BP from the PPG signal and
satisfies healthcare criteria such as the Association for the Advancement of
Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS)
standards. Furthermore, the proposed method provides the reliability of the
predicted BP by estimating its uncertainty to help diagnose medical condition
based on the model prediction. Experiments on the MIMIC II database verify the
state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method under several metrics and
its ability to accurately represent uncertainty in prediction.

    <title>Assessing Disparate Impacts of Personalized Interventions:
  Identifiability and Bounds</title>
    <summary>  Personalized interventions in social services, education, and healthcare
leverage individual-level causal effect predictions in order to give the best
treatment to each individual or to prioritize program interventions for the
individuals most likely to benefit. While the sensitivity of these domains
compels us to evaluate the fairness of such policies, we show that actually
auditing their disparate impacts per standard observational metrics, such as
true positive rates, is impossible since ground truths are unknown. Whether our
data is experimental or observational, an individual's actual outcome under an
intervention different than that received can never be known, only predicted
based on features. We prove how we can nonetheless point-identify these
quantities under the additional assumption of monotone treatment response,
which may be reasonable in many applications. We further provide a sensitivity
analysis for this assumption by means of sharp partial-identification bounds
under violations of monotonicity of varying strengths. We show how to use our
results to audit personalized interventions using partially-identified ROC and
xROC curves and demonstrate this in a case study of a French job training
dataset.

    <title>Machine Learning Research Towards Combating COVID-19: Virus Detection,
  Spread Prevention, and Medical Assistance</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has continued to rapidly
spread across countries worldwide infecting thousands and millions of people.
The virus is deadly, and people who are suffering from prior illnesses or are
older than the age of 60 are at a higher risk of mortality. Medicine and
Healthcare industries have surged towards finding a cure, and different
policies have been amended to mitigate the spread of the virus. While Machine
Learning (ML) methods have been widely used in other domains, there is now a
high demand for ML-aided diagnosis systems for screening, tracking, and
predicting the spread of COVID-19 and finding a cure against it. In this paper,
we present a journey of what role ML has played so far in combating the virus,
mainly looking at it from a screening, forecasting, and vaccine perspectives.
We present a comprehensive survey of the ML algorithms and models that can be
used on this expedition and aid with battling the virus.

    <title>Post-Contextual-Bandit Inference</title>
    <summary>  Contextual bandit algorithms are increasingly replacing non-adaptive A/B
tests in e-commerce, healthcare, and policymaking because they can both improve
outcomes for study participants and increase the chance of identifying good or
even best policies. To support credible inference on novel interventions at the
end of the study, nonetheless, we still want to construct valid confidence
intervals on average treatment effects, subgroup effects, or value of new
policies. The adaptive nature of the data collected by contextual bandit
algorithms, however, makes this difficult: standard estimators are no longer
asymptotically normally distributed and classic confidence intervals fail to
provide correct coverage. While this has been addressed in non-contextual
settings by using stabilized estimators, the contextual setting poses unique
challenges that we tackle for the first time in this paper. We propose the
Contextual Adaptive Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator, the first estimator for
policy value that is asymptotically normal under contextual adaptive data
collection. The main technical challenge in constructing CADR is designing
adaptive and consistent conditional standard deviation estimators for
stabilization. Extensive numerical experiments using 57 OpenML datasets
demonstrate that confidence intervals based on CADR uniquely provide correct
coverage.

    <title>An Accurate Non-accelerometer-based PPG Motion Artifact Removal
  Technique using CycleGAN</title>
    <summary>  A photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical
technique widely used in the healthcare domain to extract valuable
health-related information, e.g., heart rate variability, blood pressure, and
respiration rate. PPG signals can easily be collected continuously and remotely
using portable wearable devices. However, these measuring devices are
vulnerable to motion artifacts caused by daily life activities. The most common
ways to eliminate motion artifacts use extra accelerometer sensors, which
suffer from two limitations: i) high power consumption and ii) the need to
integrate an accelerometer sensor in a wearable device (which is not required
in certain wearables). This paper proposes a low-power non-accelerometer-based
PPG motion artifacts removal method outperforming the accuracy of the existing
methods. We use Cycle Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct clean PPG
signals from noisy PPG signals. Our novel machine-learning-based technique
achieves 9.5 times improvement in motion artifact removal compared to the
state-of-the-art without using extra sensors such as an accelerometer.

    <title>Fair When Trained, Unfair When Deployed: Observable Fairness Measures
  are Unstable in Performative Prediction Settings</title>
    <summary>  Many popular algorithmic fairness measures depend on the joint distribution
of predictions, outcomes, and a sensitive feature like race or gender. These
measures are sensitive to distribution shift: a predictor which is trained to
satisfy one of these fairness definitions may become unfair if the distribution
changes. In performative prediction settings, however, predictors are precisely
intended to induce distribution shift. For example, in many applications in
criminal justice, healthcare, and consumer finance, the purpose of building a
predictor is to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes such as recidivism,
hospitalization, or default on a loan. We formalize the effect of such
predictors as a type of concept shift-a particular variety of distribution
shift-and show both theoretically and via simulated examples how this causes
predictors which are fair when they are trained to become unfair when they are
deployed. We further show how many of these issues can be avoided by using
fairness definitions that depend on counterfactual rather than observable
outcomes.

    <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for Chemical Simulation and Drug
  Discovery</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing has gained a lot of attention recently, and scientists have
seen potential applications in this field using quantum computing for
Cryptography and Communication to Machine Learning and Healthcare. Protein
folding has been one of the most interesting areas to study, and it is also one
of the biggest problems of biochemistry. Each protein folds distinctively, and
the difficulty of finding its stable shape rapidly increases with an increase
in the number of amino acids in the chain. A moderate protein has about 100
amino acids, and the number of combinations one needs to verify to find the
stable structure is enormous. At some point, the number of these combinations
will be so vast that classical computers cannot even attempt to solve them. In
this paper, we examine how this problem can be solved with the help of quantum
computing using two different algorithms, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), using Qiskit Nature. We
compare the results of different quantum hardware and simulators and check how
error mitigation affects the performance. Further, we make comparisons with
SoTA algorithms and evaluate the reliability of the method.

    <title>SepVAE: a contrastive VAE to separate pathological patterns from healthy

    <summary>  Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders
(VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a
background dataset (BG) (i.e., healthy subjects) and a target dataset (TG)
(i.e., patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset. To do so,
these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e.,
proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both
datasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information
between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of
variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a
disentangling term between common and salient representations and a
classification term between background and target samples in the salient space.
We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical
applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA). Code and datasets are
available on GitHub https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2023_rlouiset_sepvae.

    <title>SUOD: Accelerating Large-Scale Unsupervised Heterogeneous Outlier
  Detection</title>
    <summary>  Outlier detection (OD) is a key machine learning (ML) task for identifying
abnormal objects from general samples with numerous high-stake applications
including fraud detection and intrusion detection. Due to the lack of ground
truth labels, practitioners often have to build a large number of unsupervised,
heterogeneous models (i.e., different algorithms with varying hyperparameters)
for further combination and analysis, rather than relying on a single model.
How to accelerate the training and scoring on new-coming samples by
outlyingness (referred as prediction throughout the paper) with a large number
of unsupervised, heterogeneous OD models? In this study, we propose a modular
acceleration system, called SUOD, to address it. The proposed system focuses on
three complementary acceleration aspects (data reduction for high-dimensional
data, approximation for costly models, and taskload imbalance optimization for
distributed environment), while maintaining performance accuracy. Extensive
experiments on more than 20 benchmark datasets demonstrate SUOD's effectiveness
in heterogeneous OD acceleration, along with a real-world deployment case on
fraudulent claim analysis at IQVIA, a leading healthcare firm. We open-source
SUOD for reproducibility and accessibility.

    <title>Multimodal Pretraining of Medical Time Series and Notes</title>
    <summary>  Within the intensive care unit (ICU), a wealth of patient data, including
clinical measurements and clinical notes, is readily available. This data is a
valuable resource for comprehending patient health and informing medical
decisions, but it also contains many challenges in analysis. Deep learning
models show promise in extracting meaningful patterns, but they require
extensive labeled data, a challenge in critical care. To address this, we
propose a novel approach employing self-supervised pretraining, focusing on the
alignment of clinical measurements and notes. Our approach combines contrastive
and masked token prediction tasks during pretraining. Semi-supervised
experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
self-supervised pretraining. In downstream tasks, including in-hospital
mortality prediction and phenotyping, our pretrained model outperforms
baselines in settings where only a fraction of the data is labeled, emphasizing
its ability to enhance ICU data analysis. Notably, our method excels in
situations where very few labels are available, as evidenced by an increase in
the AUC-ROC for in-hospital mortality by 0.17 and in AUC-PR for phenotyping by
0.1 when only 1% of labels are accessible. This work advances self-supervised
learning in the healthcare domain, optimizing clinical insights from abundant
yet challenging ICU data.

    <title>A Big Data Analytics Framework to Predict the Risk of Opioid Use
  Disorder</title>
    <summary>  Overdose related to prescription opioids have reached an epidemic level in
the US, creating an unprecedented national crisis. This has been exacerbated
partly due to the lack of tools for physicians to help predict the risk of
whether a patient will develop opioid use disorder. Little is known about how
machine learning can be applied to a big-data platform to ensure an informed,
sustained and judicious prescribing of opioids, in particular for commercially
insured population. This study explores Massachusetts All Payer Claims Data, a
de-identified healthcare dataset, and proposes a machine learning framework to
examine how na\"ive users develop opioid use disorder. We perform several
feature selections techniques to identify influential demographic and clinical
features associated with opioid use disorder from a class imbalanced analytic
sample. We then compare the predictive power of four well-known machine
learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and
Gradient Boosting to predict the risk of opioid use disorder. The study results
show that the Random Forest model outperforms the other three algorithms while
determining the features, some of which are consistent with prior clinical
findings. Moreover, alongside the higher predictive accuracy, the proposed
framework is capable of extracting some risk factors that will add significant
knowledge to what is already known in the extant literature. We anticipate that
this study will help healthcare practitioners improve the current prescribing
practice of opioids and contribute to curb the increasing rate of opioid
addiction and overdose.

    <title>A Survey on Offline Reinforcement Learning: Taxonomy, Review, and Open
  Problems</title>
    <summary>  With the widespread adoption of deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL)
has experienced a dramatic increase in popularity, scaling to previously
intractable problems, such as playing complex games from pixel observations,
sustaining conversations with humans, and controlling robotic agents. However,
there is still a wide range of domains inaccessible to RL due to the high cost
and danger of interacting with the environment. Offline RL is a paradigm that
learns exclusively from static datasets of previously collected interactions,
making it feasible to extract policies from large and diverse training
datasets. Effective offline RL algorithms have a much wider range of
applications than online RL, being particularly appealing for real-world
applications, such as education, healthcare, and robotics. In this work, we
contribute with a unifying taxonomy to classify offline RL methods.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest algorithmic
breakthroughs in the field using a unified notation as well as a review of
existing benchmarks' properties and shortcomings. Additionally, we provide a
figure that summarizes the performance of each method and class of methods on
different dataset properties, equipping researchers with the tools to decide
which type of algorithm is best suited for the problem at hand and identify
which classes of algorithms look the most promising. Finally, we provide our
perspective on open problems and propose future research directions for this
rapidly growing field.

    <title>NeurIPS'22 Cross-Domain MetaDL competition: Design and baseline results</title>
    <summary>  We present the design and baseline results for a new challenge in the
ChaLearn meta-learning series, accepted at NeurIPS'22, focusing on
"cross-domain" meta-learning. Meta-learning aims to leverage experience gained
from previous tasks to solve new tasks efficiently (i.e., with better
performance, little training data, and/or modest computational resources).
While previous challenges in the series focused on within-domain few-shot
learning problems, with the aim of learning efficiently N-way k-shot tasks
(i.e., N class classification problems with k training examples), this
competition challenges the participants to solve "any-way" and "any-shot"
problems drawn from various domains (healthcare, ecology, biology,
manufacturing, and others), chosen for their humanitarian and societal impact.
To that end, we created Meta-Album, a meta-dataset of 40 image classification
datasets from 10 domains, from which we carve out tasks with any number of
"ways" (within the range 2-20) and any number of "shots" (within the range
1-20). The competition is with code submission, fully blind-tested on the
CodaLab challenge platform. The code of the winners will be open-sourced,
enabling the deployment of automated machine learning solutions for few-shot
image classification across several domains.

    <title>Deep Transfer Learning for Automated Diagnosis of Skin Lesions from
  Photographs</title>
    <summary>  Melanoma is not the most common form of skin cancer, but it is the most
deadly. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by expert dermatologists, which is
costly and requires timely access to medical treatment. Recent advances in deep
learning have the potential to improve diagnostic performance, expedite urgent
referrals and reduce burden on clinicians. Through smart phones, the technology
could reach people who would not normally have access to such healthcare
services, e.g. in remote parts of the world, due to financial constraints or in
2020, COVID-19 cancellations. To this end, we have investigated various
transfer learning approaches by leveraging model parameters pre-trained on
ImageNet with finetuning on melanoma detection. We compare EfficientNet,
MnasNet, MobileNet, DenseNet, SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, GoogleNet, ResNet,
ResNeXt, VGG and a simple CNN with and without transfer learning. We find the
mobile network, EfficientNet (with transfer learning) achieves the best mean
performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) of 0.931$\pm$0.005 and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC)
of 0.840$\pm$0.010. This is significantly better than general practitioners
(0.83$\pm$0.03 AUROC) and dermatologists (0.91$\pm$0.02 AUROC).

    <title>Policy Learning with Adaptively Collected Data</title>
    <summary>  Learning optimal policies from historical data enables personalization in a
wide variety of applications including healthcare, digital recommendations, and
online education. The growing policy learning literature focuses on settings
where the data collection rule stays fixed throughout the experiment. However,
adaptive data collection is becoming more common in practice, from two primary
sources: 1) data collected from adaptive experiments that are designed to
improve inferential efficiency; 2) data collected from production systems that
progressively evolve an operational policy to improve performance over time
(e.g. contextual bandits). Yet adaptivity complicates the optimal policy
identification ex post, since samples are dependent, and each treatment may not
receive enough observations for each type of individual. In this paper, we make
initial research inquiries into addressing the challenges of learning the
optimal policy with adaptively collected data. We propose an algorithm based on
generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, which
non-uniformly reweight the elements of a standard AIPW estimator to control
worst-case estimation variance. We establish a finite-sample regret upper bound
for our algorithm and complement it with a regret lower bound that quantifies
the fundamental difficulty of policy learning with adaptive data. When equipped
with the best weighting scheme, our algorithm achieves minimax rate optimal
regret guarantees even with diminishing exploration. Finally, we demonstrate
our algorithm's effectiveness using both synthetic data and public benchmark
datasets.

    <title>Modular Learning Component Attacks: Today's Reality, Tomorrow's
  Challenge</title>
    <summary>  Many of today's machine learning (ML) systems are not built from scratch, but
are compositions of an array of {\em modular learning components} (MLCs). The
increasing use of MLCs significantly simplifies the ML system development
cycles. However, as most MLCs are contributed and maintained by third parties,
their lack of standardization and regulation entails profound security
implications.
  In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that potentially harmful
MLCs pose immense threats to the security of ML systems. We present a broad
class of {\em logic-bomb} attacks in which maliciously crafted MLCs trigger
host systems to malfunction in a predictable manner. By empirically studying
two state-of-the-art ML systems in the healthcare domain, we explore the
feasibility of such attacks. For example, we show that, without prior knowledge
about the host ML system, by modifying only 3.3{\textperthousand} of the MLC's
parameters, each with distortion below $10^{-3}$, the adversary is able to
force the misdiagnosis of target victims' skin cancers with 100\% success rate.
We provide analytical justification for the success of such attacks, which
points to the fundamental characteristics of today's ML models: high
dimensionality, non-linearity, and non-convexity. The issue thus seems
fundamental to many ML systems. We further discuss potential countermeasures to
mitigate MLC-based attacks and their potential technical challenges.

    <title>Interpretable Classification of Time-Series Data using Efficient
  Enumerative Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Cyber-physical system applications such as autonomous vehicles, wearable
devices, and avionic systems generate a large volume of time-series data.
Designers often look for tools to help classify and categorize the data.
Traditional machine learning techniques for time-series data offer several
solutions to solve these problems; however, the artifacts trained by these
algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand, temporal logics,
such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in the formal
methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work, we
propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulae that are
able to cluster and classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on
learning STL formulas from data either assumes a formula-template to be given
by the user, or assumes some special fragment of STL that enables exploring the
formula structure in a systematic fashion. In our technique, we relax these
assumptions, and provide a way to systematically explore the space of all STL
formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large, and contains many
semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically prune
the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on
various case studies from the automotive, transportation and healthcare domain.

    <title>Anomaly Detection in Echocardiograms with Dynamic Variational Trajectory
  Models</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel anomaly detection method for echocardiogram videos. The
introduced method takes advantage of the periodic nature of the heart cycle to
learn three variants of a variational latent trajectory model (TVAE). While the
first two variants (TVAE-C and TVAE-R) model strict periodic movements of the
heart, the third (TVAE-S) is more general and allows shifts in the spatial
representation throughout the video. All models are trained on the healthy
samples of a novel in-house dataset of infant echocardiogram videos consisting
of multiple chamber views to learn a normative prior of the healthy population.
During inference, maximum a posteriori (MAP) based anomaly detection is
performed to detect out-of-distribution samples in our dataset. The proposed
method reliably identifies severe congenital heart defects, such as Ebstein's
Anomaly or Shone-complex. Moreover, it achieves superior performance over
MAP-based anomaly detection with standard variational autoencoders when
detecting pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dilation. Finally, we
demonstrate that the proposed method enables interpretable explanations of its
output through heatmaps highlighting the regions corresponding to anomalous
heart structures.

    <title>Simulating Battery-Powered TinyML Systems Optimised using Reinforcement
  Learning in Image-Based Anomaly Detection</title>
    <summary>  Advances in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) have bolstered the creation of
smart industry solutions, including smart agriculture, healthcare and smart
cities. Whilst related research contributes to enabling TinyML solutions on
constrained hardware, there is a need to amplify real-world applications by
optimising energy consumption in battery-powered systems. The work presented
extends and contributes to TinyML research by optimising battery-powered
image-based anomaly detection Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Whilst previous
work in this area has yielded the capabilities of on-device inferencing and
training, there has yet to be an investigation into optimising the management
of such capabilities using machine learning approaches, such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), to improve the deployment battery life of such systems. Using
modelled simulations, the battery life effects of an RL algorithm are
benchmarked against static and dynamic optimisation approaches, with the
foundation laid for a hardware benchmark to follow. It is shown that using RL
within a TinyML-enabled IoT system to optimise the system operations, including
cloud anomaly processing and on-device training, yields an improved battery
life of 22.86% and 10.86% compared to static and dynamic optimisation
approaches respectively. The proposed solution can be deployed to
resource-constrained hardware, given its low memory footprint of 800 B, which
could be further reduced. This further facilitates the real-world deployment of
such systems, including key sectors such as smart agriculture.

    <title>TimeDRL: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multivariate
  Time-Series</title>
    <summary>  Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g.,
healthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of
labels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have
shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on
labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing
issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these
challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series
representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings.
TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation
of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data
using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and
instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the
former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the
latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii)
avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as
transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments
on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets
have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning
approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 58.02% in MSE
and classification by 1.48% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation
studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's
architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its
effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data. The code
is available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/TimeDRL.

    <title>Memory Wrap: a Data-Efficient and Interpretable Extension to Image
  Classification Models</title>
    <summary>  Due to their black-box and data-hungry nature, deep learning techniques are
not yet widely adopted for real-world applications in critical domains, like
healthcare and justice. This paper presents Memory Wrap, a plug-and-play
extension to any image classification model. Memory Wrap improves both
data-efficiency and model interpretability, adopting a content-attention
mechanism between the input and some memories of past training samples. We show
that Memory Wrap outperforms standard classifiers when it learns from a limited
set of data, and it reaches comparable performance when it learns from the full
dataset. We discuss how its structure and content-attention mechanisms make
predictions interpretable, compared to standard classifiers. To this end, we
both show a method to build explanations by examples and counterfactuals, based
on the memory content, and how to exploit them to get insights about its
decision process. We test our approach on image classification tasks using
several architectures on three different datasets, namely CIFAR10, SVHN, and
CINIC10.

    <title>A Study of Data-driven Methods for Adaptive Forecasting of COVID-19
  Cases</title>
    <summary>  Severe acute respiratory disease SARS-CoV-2 has had a found impact on public
health systems and healthcare emergency response especially with respect to
making decisions on the most effective measures to be taken at any given time.
As demonstrated throughout the last three years with COVID-19, the prediction
of the number of positive cases can be an effective way to facilitate
decision-making. However, the limited availability of data and the highly
dynamic and uncertain nature of the virus transmissibility makes this task very
challenging. Aiming at investigating these challenges and in order to address
this problem, this work studies data-driven (learning, statistical) methods for
incrementally training models to adapt to these nonstationary conditions. An
extensive empirical study is conducted to examine various characteristics, such
as, performance analysis on a per virus wave basis, feature extraction,
"lookback" window size, memory size, all for next-, 7-, and 14-day forecasting
tasks. We demonstrate that the incremental learning framework can successfully
address the aforementioned challenges and perform well during outbreaks,
providing accurate predictions.

    <title>SCouT: Synthetic Counterfactuals via Spatiotemporal Transformers for
  Actionable Healthcare</title>
    <summary>  The Synthetic Control method has pioneered a class of powerful data-driven
techniques to estimate the counterfactual reality of a unit from donor units.
At its core, the technique involves a linear model fitted on the
pre-intervention period that combines donor outcomes to yield the
counterfactual. However, linearly combining spatial information at each time
instance using time-agnostic weights fails to capture important inter-unit and
intra-unit temporal contexts and complex nonlinear dynamics of real data. We
instead propose an approach to use local spatiotemporal information before the
onset of the intervention as a promising way to estimate the counterfactual
sequence. To this end, we suggest a Transformer model that leverages particular
positional embeddings, a modified decoder attention mask, and a novel
pre-training task to perform spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence modeling. Our
experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the efficacy of our method in the
typical small donor pool setting and its robustness against noise. We also
generate actionable healthcare insights at the population and patient levels by
simulating a state-wide public health policy to evaluate its effectiveness, an
in silico trial for asthma medications to support randomized controlled trials,
and a medical intervention for patients with Friedreich's ataxia to improve
clinical decision-making and promote personalized therapy.

    <title>Rare Disease Physician Targeting: A Factor Graph Approach</title>
    <summary>  In rare disease physician targeting, a major challenge is how to identify
physicians who are treating diagnosed or underdiagnosed rare diseases patients.
Rare diseases have extremely low incidence rate. For a specified rare disease,
only a small number of patients are affected and a fractional of physicians are
involved. The existing targeting methodologies, such as segmentation and
profiling, are developed under mass market assumption. They are not suitable
for rare disease market where the target classes are extremely imbalanced. The
authors propose a graphical model approach to predict targets by jointly
modeling physician and patient features from different data spaces and
utilizing the extra relational information. Through an empirical example with
medical claim and prescription data, the proposed approach demonstrates better
accuracy in finding target physicians. The graph representation also provides
visual interpretability of relationship among physicians and patients. The
model can be extended to incorporate more complex dependency structures. This
article contributes to the literature of exploring the benefit of utilizing
relational dependencies among entities in healthcare industry.

    <title>Online Heart Rate Prediction using Acceleration from a Wrist Worn
  Wearable</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we study the prediction of heart rate from acceleration using a
wrist worn wearable. Although existing photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate
sensors provide reliable measurements, they use considerably more energy than
accelerometers and have a major impact on battery life of wearable devices. By
using energy-efficient accelerometers to predict heart rate, significant energy
savings can be made. Further, we are interested in understanding patient
recovery after a heart rate intervention, where we expect a variation in heart
rate over time. Therefore, we propose an online approach to tackle the concept
as time passes. We evaluate the methods on approximately 4 weeks of free living
data from three patients over a number of months. We show that our approach can
achieve good predictive performance (e.g., 2.89 Mean Absolute Error) while
using the PPG heart rate sensor infrequently (e.g., 20.25% of the samples).

    <title>A Hybrid Recommender System for Patient-Doctor Matchmaking in Primary
  Care</title>
    <summary>  We partner with a leading European healthcare provider and design a mechanism
to match patients with family doctors in primary care. We define the
matchmaking process for several distinct use cases given different levels of
available information about patients. Then, we adopt a hybrid recommender
system to present each patient a list of family doctor recommendations. In
particular, we model patient trust of family doctors using a large-scale
dataset of consultation histories, while accounting for the temporal dynamics
of their relationships. Our proposed approach shows higher predictive accuracy
than both a heuristic baseline and a collaborative filtering approach, and the
proposed trust measure further improves model performance.

    <title>Privacy Mining from IoT-based Smart Homes</title>
    <summary>  Recently, a wide range of smart devices are deployed in a variety of
environments to improve the quality of human life. One of the important
IoT-based applications is smart homes for healthcare, especially for elders.
IoT-based smart homes enable elders' health to be properly monitored and taken
care of. However, elders' privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to
non-fully protected network communication or other reasons. To demonstrate how
serious this issue is, we introduce in this paper a Privacy Mining Approach
(PMA) to mine privacy from smart homes by conducting a series of deductions and
analyses on sensor datasets generated by smart homes. The experimental results
demonstrate that PMA is able to deduce a global sensor topology for a smart
home and disclose elders' privacy in terms of their house layouts.

    <title>Explaining Models by Propagating Shapley Values of Local Components</title>
    <summary>  In healthcare, making the best possible predictions with complex models
(e.g., neural networks, ensembles/stacks of different models) can impact
patient welfare. In order to make these complex models explainable, we present
DeepSHAP for mixed model types, a framework for layer wise propagation of
Shapley values that builds upon DeepLIFT (an existing approach for explaining
neural networks). We show that in addition to being able to explain neural
networks, this new framework naturally enables attributions for stacks of mixed
models (e.g., neural network feature extractor into a tree model) as well as
attributions of the loss. Finally, we theoretically justify a method for
obtaining attributions with respect to a background distribution (under a
Shapley value framework).

    <title>Activity Detection from Wearable Electromyogram Sensors using Hidden
  Markov Model</title>
    <summary>  Surface electromyography (sEMG) has gained significant importance during
recent advancements in consumer electronics for healthcare systems, gesture
analysis and recognition and sign language communication. For such a system, it
is imperative to determine the regions of activity in a continuously recorded
sEMG signal. The proposed work provides a novel activity detection approach
based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) using sEMG signals recorded when various
hand gestures are performed. Detection procedure is designed based on a
probabilistic outlook by making use of mathematical models. The requirement of
a threshold for activity detection is obviated making it subject and activity
independent. Correctness of the predicted outputs is asserted by classifying
the signal segments around the detected transition regions as activity or rest.
Classified outputs are compared with the transition regions in a stimulus given
to the subject to perform the activity. The activity onsets are detected with
an average of 96.25% accuracy whereas the activity termination regions with an
average of 87.5% accuracy with the considered set of six activities and four
subjects.

    <title>Patient Similarity Analysis with Longitudinal Health Data</title>
    <summary>  Healthcare professionals have long envisioned using the enormous processing
powers of computers to discover new facts and medical knowledge locked inside
electronic health records. These vast medical archives contain time-resolved
information about medical visits, tests and procedures, as well as outcomes,
which together form individual patient journeys. By assessing the similarities
among these journeys, it is possible to uncover clusters of common disease
trajectories with shared health outcomes. The assignment of patient journeys to
specific clusters may in turn serve as the basis for personalized outcome
prediction and treatment selection. This procedure is a non-trivial
computational problem, as it requires the comparison of patient data with
multi-dimensional and multi-modal features that are captured at different times
and resolutions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the
tools and methods that are used in patient similarity analysis with
longitudinal data and discuss its potential for improving clinical decision
making.

    <title>Variable Importance Clouds: A Way to Explore Variable Importance for the
  Set of Good Models</title>
    <summary>  Variable importance is central to scientific studies, including the social
sciences and causal inference, healthcare, and other domains. However, current
notions of variable importance are often tied to a specific predictive model.
This is problematic: what if there were multiple well-performing predictive
models, and a specific variable is important to some of them and not to others?
In that case, we may not be able to tell from a single well-performing model
whether a variable is always important in predicting the outcome. Rather than
depending on variable importance for a single predictive model, we would like
to explore variable importance for all approximately-equally-accurate
predictive models. This work introduces the concept of a variable importance
cloud, which maps every variable to its importance for every good predictive
model. We show properties of the variable importance cloud and draw connections
to other areas of statistics. We introduce variable importance diagrams as a
projection of the variable importance cloud into two dimensions for
visualization purposes. Experiments with criminal justice, marketing data, and
image classification tasks illustrate how variables can change dramatically in
importance for approximately-equally-accurate predictive models

    <title>Uncertainty estimation for classification and risk prediction on medical
  tabular data</title>
    <summary>  In a data-scarce field such as healthcare, where models often deliver
predictions on patients with rare conditions, the ability to measure the
uncertainty of a model's prediction could potentially lead to improved
effectiveness of decision support tools and increased user trust. This work
advances the understanding of uncertainty estimation for classification and
risk prediction on medical tabular data, in a two-fold way. First, we expand
and refine the set of heuristics to select an uncertainty estimation technique,
introducing tests for clinically-relevant scenarios such as generalization to
uncommon pathologies, changes in clinical protocol and simulations of corrupted
data. We furthermore differentiate these heuristics depending on the clinical
use-case. Second, we observe that ensembles and related techniques perform
poorly when it comes to detecting out-of-domain examples, a critical task which
is carried out more successfully by auto-encoders. These remarks are enriched
by considerations of the interplay of uncertainty estimation with class
imbalance, post-modeling calibration and other modeling procedures. Our
findings are supported by an array of experiments on toy and real-world data.

    <title>Data augmentation using generative networks to identify dementia</title>
    <summary>  Data limitation is one of the most common issues in training machine learning
classifiers for medical applications. Due to ethical concerns and data privacy,
the number of people that can be recruited to such experiments is generally
smaller than the number of participants contributing to non-healthcare
datasets. Recent research showed that generative models can be used as an
effective approach for data augmentation, which can ultimately help to train
more robust classifiers sparse data domains. A number of studies proved that
this data augmentation technique works for image and audio data sets. In this
paper, we investigate the application of a similar approach to different types
of speech and audio-based features extracted from interactions recorded with
our automatic dementia detection system. Using two generative models we show
how the generated synthesized samples can improve the performance of a DNN
based classifier. The variational autoencoder increased the F-score of a
four-way classifier distinguishing the typical patient groups seen in memory
clinics from 58% to around 74%, a 16% improvement

    <title>Recovering Loss to Followup Information Using Denoising Autoencoders</title>
    <summary>  Loss to followup is a significant issue in healthcare and has serious
consequences for a study's validity and cost. Methods available at present for
recovering loss to followup information are restricted by their expressive
capabilities and struggle to model highly non-linear relations and complex
interactions. In this paper we propose a model based on overcomplete denoising
autoencoders to recover loss to followup information. Designed to work with
high volume data, results on various simulated and real life datasets show our
model is appropriate under varying dataset and loss to followup conditions and
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin ($\ge 20\%$ in some
scenarios) while preserving the dataset utility for final analysis.

    <title>Identifying Causal-Effect Inference Failure with Uncertainty-Aware
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Recommending the best course of action for an individual is a major
application of individual-level causal effect estimation. This application is
often needed in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, where estimating
and communicating uncertainty to decision-makers is crucial. We introduce a
practical approach for integrating uncertainty estimation into a class of
state-of-the-art neural network methods used for individual-level causal
estimates. We show that our methods enable us to deal gracefully with
situations of "no-overlap", common in high-dimensional data, where standard
applications of causal effect approaches fail. Further, our methods allow us to
handle covariate shift, where test distribution differs to train distribution,
common when systems are deployed in practice. We show that when such a
covariate shift occurs, correctly modeling uncertainty can keep us from giving
overconfident and potentially harmful recommendations. We demonstrate our
methodology with a range of state-of-the-art models. Under both covariate shift
and lack of overlap, our uncertainty-equipped methods can alert decisions
makers when predictions are not to be trusted while outperforming their
uncertainty-oblivious counterparts.

    <title>RTFN: Robust Temporal Feature Network</title>
    <summary>  Time series analysis plays a vital role in various applications, for
instance, healthcare, weather prediction, disaster forecast, etc. However, to
obtain sufficient shapelets by a feature network is still challenging. To this
end, we propose a novel robust temporal feature network (RTFN) that contains
temporal feature networks and attentional LSTM networks. The temporal feature
networks are built to extract basic features from input data while the
attentional LSTM networks are devised to capture complicated shapelets and
relationships to enrich features. In experiments, we embed RTFN into supervised
structure as a feature extraction network and into unsupervised clustering as
an encoder, respectively. The results show that the RTFN-based supervised
structure is a winner of 40 out of 85 datasets and the RTFN-based unsupervised
clustering performs the best on 4 out of 11 datasets in the UCR2018 archive.

    <title>Forecasting Emergency Department Capacity Constraints for COVID
  Isolation Beds</title>
    <summary>  Predicting patient volumes in a hospital setting is a well-studied
application of time series forecasting. Existing tools usually make forecasts
at the daily or weekly level to assist in planning for staffing requirements.
Prompted by new COVID-related capacity constraints placed on our pediatric
hospital's emergency department, we developed an hourly forecasting tool to
make predictions over a 24 hour window. These forecasts would give our hospital
sufficient time to be able to martial resources towards expanding capacity and
augmenting staff (e.g. transforming wards or bringing in physicians on call).
Using Gaussian Process Regressions (GPRs), we obtain strong performance for
both point predictions (average R-squared: 82%) as well as classification
accuracy when predicting the ordinal tiers of our hospital's capacity (average
precision/recall: 82%/74%). Compared to traditional regression approaches, GPRs
not only obtain consistently higher performance, but are also robust to the
dataset shifts that have occurred throughout 2020. Hospital stakeholders are
encouraged by the strength of our results, and we are currently working on
moving our tool to a real-time setting with the goal of augmenting the
capabilities of our healthcare workers.

    <title>Exploring Gender Disparities in Time to Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  Sex and gender-based healthcare disparities contribute to differences in
health outcomes. We focus on time to diagnosis (TTD) by conducting two
large-scale, complementary analyses among men and women across 29 phenotypes
and 195K patients. We first find that women are consistently more likely to
experience a longer TTD than men, even when presenting with the same
conditions. We further explore how TTD disparities affect diagnostic
performance between genders, both across and persistent to time, by evaluating
gender-agnostic disease classifiers across increasing diagnostic information.
In both fairness analyses, the diagnostic process favors men over women,
contradicting the previous observation that women may demonstrate relevant
symptoms earlier than men. These analyses suggest that TTD is an important yet
complex aspect when studying gender disparities, and warrants further
investigation.

    <title>Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series</title>
    <summary>  Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all
at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits,
each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g.,
whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession
should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition,
we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series
data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient
data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering
invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical
prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen
(downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on
regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding
irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble
(MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on
inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments
show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from
51.53% to 53.92%.

    <title>A Random Interaction Forest for Prioritizing Predictive Biomarkers</title>
    <summary>  Precision medicine is becoming a focus in medical research recently, as its
implementation brings values to all stakeholders in the healthcare system.
Various statistical methodologies have been developed tackling problems in
different aspects of this field, e.g., assessing treatment heterogeneity,
identifying patient subgroups, or building treatment decision models. However,
there is a lack of new tools devoted to selecting and prioritizing predictive
biomarkers. We propose a novel tree-based ensemble method, random interaction
forest (RIF), to generate predictive importance scores and prioritize candidate
biomarkers for constructing refined treatment decision models. RIF was
evaluated by comparing with the conventional random forest and univariable
regression methods and showed favorable properties under various simulation
scenarios. We applied the proposed RIF method to a biomarker dataset from two
phase III clinical trials of bezlotoxumab on $\textit{Clostridium difficile}$
infection recurrence and obtained biologically meaningful results.

    <title>Physical Exercise Recommendation and Success Prediction Using
  Interconnected Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Unhealthy behaviors, e.g., physical inactivity and unhealthful food choice,
are the primary healthcare cost drivers in developed countries. Pervasive
computational, sensing, and communication technology provided by smartphones
and smartwatches have made it possible to support individuals in their everyday
lives to develop healthier lifestyles. In this paper, we propose an exercise
recommendation system that also predicts individual success rates. The system,
consisting of two inter-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), uses the
history of workouts to recommend the next workout activity for each individual.
The system then predicts the probability of successful completion of the
predicted activity by the individual. The prediction accuracy of this
interconnected-RNN model is assessed on previously published data from a
four-week mobile health experiment and is shown to improve upon previous
predictions from a computational cognitive model.

    <title>Early Prediction of Heart Disease Using PCA and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm
  with k-Means</title>
    <summary>  Worldwide research shows that millions of lives lost per year because of
heart disease. The healthcare sector produces massive volumes of data on heart
disease that are sadly not used to locate secret knowledge for successful
decision making. One of the most important aspects at this moment is detecting
heart disease at an early stage. Researchers have applied distinct techniques
to the UCI Machine Learning heart disease dataset. Many researchers have tried
to apply some complex techniques to this dataset, where detailed studies are
still missing. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used
to reduce attributes. Apart from a Hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) with k-means
used for final clustering. Typically, the k-means method is using for
clustering the data. This type of clustering can get stuck in the local optima
because this method is heuristic. We used the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA)
for data clustering to avoid this problem. Our proposed method can predict
early heart disease with an accuracy of 94.06%.

    <title>Improving X-ray Diagnostics through Eye-Tracking and XR</title>
    <summary>  There is a growing need to assist radiologists in performing X-ray readings
and diagnoses fast, comfortably, and effectively. As radiologists strive to
maximize productivity, it is essential to consider the impact of reading rooms
in interpreting complex examinations and ensure that higher volume and
reporting speeds do not compromise patient outcomes. Virtual Reality (VR) is a
disruptive technology for clinical practice in assessing X-ray images. We argue
that conjugating eye-tracking with VR devices and Machine Learning may overcome
obstacles posed by inadequate ergonomic postures and poor room conditions that
often cause erroneous diagnostics when professionals examine digital images.

    <title>Do-AIQ: A Design-of-Experiment Approach to Quality Evaluation of AI
  Mislabel Detection Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  The quality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms is of significant
importance for confidently adopting algorithms in various applications such as
cybersecurity, healthcare, and autonomous driving. This work presents a
principled framework of using a design-of-experimental approach to
systematically evaluate the quality of AI algorithms, named as Do-AIQ.
Specifically, we focus on investigating the quality of the AI mislabel data
algorithm against data poisoning. The performance of AI algorithms is affected
by hyperparameters in the algorithm and data quality, particularly, data
mislabeling, class imbalance, and data types. To evaluate the quality of the AI
algorithms and obtain a trustworthy assessment on the quality of the
algorithms, we establish a design-of-experiment framework to construct an
efficient space-filling design in a high-dimensional constraint space and
develop an effective surrogate model using additive Gaussian process to enable
the emulation of the quality of AI algorithms. Both theoretical and numerical
studies are conducted to justify the merits of the proposed framework. The
proposed framework can set an exemplar for AI algorithm to enhance the AI
assurance of robustness, reproducibility, and transparency.
