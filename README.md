# Tokenomics Planner

Tokenomics Planner is a web application designed to help you plan and simulate tokenomics for your blockchain projects. It allows you to create token distribution plans, simulate market conditions, and generate key performance indicators (KPIs) for your project.

## Features

- **Token Distribution Planning**: Create and manage categories for token distribution with customizable vesting schedules.
- **Market Simulation**: Simulate market conditions over time to predict token price, market cap, and other key metrics.
- **Vesting Schedule Types**: Support for linear, exponential, logarithmic, and cliff vesting schedules.
- **KPI Generation**: Generate KPIs such as circulating supply, market cap, annualized inflation, and treasury reserves.
- **Stress Testing**: Run stress tests to simulate the impact of significant market changes.
